    "This tutorial contains an introduction to word embeddings. You will train your own word embeddings using a simple Keras model for a sentiment classification task, and then visualize them in the [Embedding Projector](http://projector.tensorflow.org) (shown in the image below). \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/text/guide/images/embedding.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of the embedding projector\" width=\"400\"/>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Representing text as numbers\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Machine learning models take vectors (arrays of numbers) as input. When working with text, the first thing you must do is come up with a strategy to convert strings to numbers (or to \"vectorize\" the text) before feeding it to the model. In this section, you will look at three strategies for doing so.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### One-hot encodings\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "As a first idea, you might \"one-hot\" encode each word in your vocabulary. Consider the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\". The vocabulary (or unique words) in this sentence is (cat, mat, on, sat, the). To represent each word, you will create a zero vector with length equal to the vocabulary, then place a one in the index that corresponds to the word. This approach is shown in the following diagram.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/text/guide/images/one-hot.png\" alt=\"Diagram of one-hot encodings\" width=\"400\" />\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To create a vector that contains the encoding of the sentence, you could then concatenate the one-hot vectors for each word.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Key point: This approach is inefficient. A one-hot encoded vector is sparse (meaning, most indices are zero). Imagine you have 10,000 words in the vocabulary. To one-hot encode each word, you would create a vector where 99.99% of the elements are zero.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Encode each word with a unique number\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A second approach you might try is to encode each word using a unique number. Continuing the example above, you could assign 1 to \"cat\", 2 to \"mat\", and so on. You could then encode the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\" as a dense vector like [5, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2]. This appoach is efficient. Instead of a sparse vector, you now have a dense one (where all elements are full).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "There are two downsides to this approach, however:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* The integer-encoding is arbitrary (it does not capture any relationship between words).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* An integer-encoding can be challenging for a model to interpret. A linear classifier, for example, learns a single weight for each feature. Because there is no relationship between the similarity of any two words and the similarity of their encodings, this feature-weight combination is not meaningful.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Word embeddings\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Word embeddings give us a way to use an efficient, dense representation in which similar words have a similar encoding. Importantly, you do not have to specify this encoding by hand. An embedding is a dense vector of floating point values (the length of the vector is a parameter you specify). Instead of specifying the values for the embedding manually, they are trainable parameters (weights learned by the model during training, in the same way a model learns weights for a dense layer). It is common to see word embeddings that are 8-dimensional (for small datasets), up to 1024-dimensions when working with large datasets. A higher dimensional embedding can capture fine-grained relationships between words, but takes more data to learn.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/text/guide/images/embedding2.png\" alt=\"Diagram of an embedding\" width=\"400\"/>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Above is a diagram for a word embedding. Each word is represented as a 4-dimensional vector of floating point values. Another way to think of an embedding is as \"lookup table\". After these weights have been learned, you can encode each word by looking up the dense vector it corresponds to in the table."

This is why people are giving it such high ratings. It's extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons MOST of the audience.\"\n",
      "2 b\"For some reason, people seem to have a problem differentiating this movie from Trail of the Pink Panther.<br /><br />At any rate, this work does nothing but serve to remind us how sad the world is without Peter Sellers in it.<br /><br />They brought back the same old favorites from Trail (Dreyfus, Cato, Litton, etc.), but they introduced a misdirected Pratt-fall humorist into a role which was designed to substitute for the missing Clouseau. <br /><br />Dreyfus devises a way to produce the perfect copy of Clouseau via a hard frame computer system which factors the variables and tosses out the name of the most inept idiot in the global law enforcement family. What we got was a poor guy who was obviously overwhelmed by the grand scale of what Blake Edwards proposed he should do, and boy does it show.<br /><br />Ted Wass was amiable as Sergeant Clifton Sleigh, but let's face it...he wasn't Clouseau in any way. I realize that Blake Edwards was losing his greatest cash cow, but to disrespect Sellers' memory like this was just sacrilege. Frankly, I'm glad they have remade the original. I hope it runs a long line of successful ventures for Steve Martin.<br /><br />This dreck rates a 2.0/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.\"\n",

He finds himself caught up with a group of would-be stars all trying to gain a break but none of them are able to do so.<br /><br />I was ready for a good comedy, but was bitterly disappointed. Jimeoin is a great comedian but this smacked of 'try hard' and it just failed. There were a few moments where I laughed out aloud and I recognised several moments of clever humour, but it wasn't enough. I enjoyed spotting the good familiar Aussie actors and scenes around Melbourne. I think you should spend your money seeing something else...\"\n",

Poor Bela was continuing his spiraling descent from the triumph of Dracula to working for Ed Wood. He actually has a half comedic, half heroic role in this movie, but mostly he spends the movie being a distraction from what could laughably be called a plot.<br /><br />One has to wonder if the Scooby-Doo cartoons were inspired by movies like this. YOu had everything you see in your average Scooby cartoon- secret passages, some guy in a costume, ulterior motives (which, unlike a Scooby cartoon, don\\'t actually make sense here.) <br /><br />Okay, the Ritz Brothers. They were a very popular vaudeville act back in the day, but no one remembers them much today. Watching this film, you can see why. They didn\\'t have the comic timing, distinct personalities or perfect slapstick of the Three Stooges or Marx Brothers. They were pretty much interchangeable, with Jimmy and Al mugging while Harry got most of the dialog.<br /><br />There is a bit of interesting Hollywood history that the Ritzes staged a \"walkout\" on this film, to protest the quality of the script. 20th Century Fox should have let them walk and reworked the script. Instead, they finished the movie, and Fox kicked them to the curb.<br /><br />I don\\'t understand the plot. I guess that Atwill was supposed to be the villain, but really the guy who was pretending to be SEC agent was the actual killer, but it was never clear why he was killing people or why he would walk into the trap that Atwill and Lugosi had set for him. The ending makes absolutely no sense.<br /><br />You almost get the impression that there were a lot of b-listers (The Ritzes, Lugosi, Atwill, Patsy Kelly) who were insisting that THEY get more screen time than the others. Other characters, like the \"seaman\" who is found in the closet, are introduced and no explanation is given as to what they were doing there.'\n",

What you will find instead is that they believe the promises Christ made of a resurrection. So, even even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity, Jehovah can, and will correct this.<br /><br />It really gets down to a simple question: is God real to you or is this all just make believe? If he is real, and you trust him, you will follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be.<br /><br />I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One in my family was horrified when she saw the words \"NO BLOOD\" written in large letters over my chart. I reasoned with her that if I were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life, would that be a good time to anger the only one could return me to life when the time came? She didn\\'t get it -- God just isn\\'t real enough to her. Too bad. I wish she could have the comfort a strong faith gives.'\n"
