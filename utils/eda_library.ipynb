    "In this delivery the student will need to create its won library (module). The library must include the EDA/useful functions that we are seeing in class, you find or create. \n",

    "A python library is a \".py\" file that contains python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some requirements: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each functionality must be done in functions.\n",
    "- Each function must be general. It must be useful for the most of cases.\n",
    "- Functions must not have repeated code. Each function must do something specific and different from the other functions.\n",
    "- The library should import others libraries as numpy, pandas, ...\n",
    "- Try to create a module \".py\" for each type of functionalty. If you are creating visualizing funcions, then the functions will be in a \"my_visualizing_functions_module.py\", for example. If you are creating analysis functions, then they will be in a \"my_analysis_functions_module.py\", for example. \n",
    "- Each function must be well documented. It must explain the functionality and each function param. \n",
    "- The code must be done in a \".py\" file. \n",
