The field of Data Science is not a single step process. It has many steps involved in it. These steps are listed below.

-----------

**1.Project Analysis**: This step is more inclined towards Project Management and Resource Assessment than it is a direct implementation of algorithms. Instead of starting a project blindly, it is crucial to determine the requirements of the project in terms of the source of data and its availability, the number of human resource available and if the budget allocated for the project is sufficient to successfully complete it.

------------

**2.Data Preparation**: In this step, the raw data is converted to structured data and is cleaned. This involves Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Handling of Missing Values, Transformation of data and Visualization. From this step onwards, programming languages like R and Python is used to achieve results for big datasets.

------------

**3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This is a crucial step in Data Science, where the Data Scientist explores the data from various angles and tries to draw initial conclusions from the data. This includes Data Visualization, Rapid Prototyping, Feature Selection, and finally Model Selection. A different set of tools are used in this step. The most commonly used are R or Python for scripting and Data Manipulation, SQL for interacting with Databases, and different libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

------------

**4.Model Building**: Once the type of model to be used is determined from the EDA, most of the resources are channeled towards the development of the model with ideal hyperparameters (modifiable parameters), such that it can perform predictive analysis on similar but unseen data. Various Machine Learning techniques applied to the data, like Clustering, Regression, Classification or PCA (Principal Component Analysis) in order to extract valuable insights from it.

------------

**5.Deployment**: After the model has been built successfully, it is time to bring the model out to the real world from its sandbox. This is where model deployment comes to the picture. Up until now, all the steps were dedicated to rapid prototyping. However, once the model has been successfully built and trained, the main application of it is in the real world, where it is deployed. This can be in the form of a web app, mobile app, or it can be run in the back-end of the server to crunch high-frequency data.

------------

**6.Real World Testing and Results**: After the model has been deployed, it faces unseen data from the real world in real time. The model may perform very well in the sandbox, but fail to perform adequately after deployment. This is the phase where constant monitoring of the model output is required in order to detect scenarios where the model fails. If it does fail at some point, the development process goes back to Step 1. If the model succeeds, the key findings are noted and reported to the stakeholders.
