162,adaptation,See her? I fucked her up the ass.
163,adaptation,"Look, I'll tell you a story, all right? I once feel deeply, you know, profoundly in love with tropical fish. Had 60 goddamn fish tanks in my house. I skin dived to find just the right ones. Anisotremus virginicus, Holdacanthus ciliaris, Chaetodon capistratus. You name it. Then one day I say, ""fuck fish"". I renounce fish. I vow never to set foot in that ocean again. That's how much ""fuck fish""."

165,adaptation,"Okay, well here's the twist. We find out that, that the killer really suffers from multiple personality disorder, right? See, he's actually really the cop and the girl. All of them are him. Isn't that fucked up?"

170,affliction,"You will say that I should have known terrible things were about to happen. You will say that I was responsible. But even so, what could I have done by then? Wade lived on the edge of his emotions. He was always first to receive the brunt of our father's anger. He had no perspective to retreat to, even in a crisis."
171,affliction,This is the story of my older brother's strange criminal behaviour and disappearance. We who loved him no longer speak of Wade. It's as if he never existed.

180,agnes of god,As much as God loves you
181,agnes of god,"I don't know the meaning behind the song she sang. Perhaps it was a song of seduction, and the father was a field hand. Perhaps the song was simply a lullaby she remembered from many years ago, and the father was hope, and love, and desire and a belief in miracles. I want to believe that she was blessed. And I do miss her. And I hope she's left something; some little part of herself with me. That would be miracle enough, wouldn't it?"

200,airplane,"Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever and dryness of the throat. When the virus penetrates the red blood cells, the victim becomes dizzy, begins to experience an itchy rash, then the poison goes to work on the central nervous system, severe muscle spasms followed by the inevitable grueling.  At this point, the entire digestive system collapses accompanied by uncontrollable flatulence  Until finally, the poor bastard is reduced to a quivering wasted piece of jelly."

251,all about eve,"That I should want you at all suddenly strikes me as the height of improbability. But that in itself is probably the reason: You're an improbable person, Eve, and so am I.

264,all about eve,"Funny business, a woman's career - the things you drop on your way up the ladder so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you get back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common, whether we like it or not: being a woman. Sooner or later, we've got to work at it, no matter how many other careers we've had or wanted. And in the last analysis, nothing's any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turn around in bed, and there he is. Without that, you're not a woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings, but you're not a woman. Slow curtain, the end."

318,amadeus,"While my father prayed earnestly to God to protect commerce, I would offer up secretly the proudest prayer a boy could think of: Lord, make me a great composer. Let me celebrate Your glory through music and be celebrated myself. Make me famous through the world, dear God. Make me immortal. After I die, let people speak my name forever with love for what I wrote. In return, I will give You my chastity, my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life, Amen."
319,amadeus,"All I wanted was to sing to God. He gave me that longing... and then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to praise him with music, why implant the desire? Like a lust in my body! And then deny me the talent?"
320,amadeus,"Sire, only opera can do this. In a play if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise, no one can understand a word. But with opera, with music... with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at the same time, and it's not noise, it's a perfect harmony!"
321,amadeus,"That doesn't really work, does it?"
322,amadeus,"That was Mozart. That! That giggling dirty-minded creature I had just seen, crawling on the floor!"

331,amadeus,Can you remember no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe. I wrote 40 operas alone.
332,amadeus,"I will speak for you, Father. I speak for all mediocrities in the world. I am their champion. I am their patron saint."
333,amadeus,"On the page it looked nothing. The beginning simple, almost comic. Just a pulse - bassoons and basset horns - like a rusty squeezebox. Then suddenly - high above it - an oboe, a single note, hanging there unwavering, till a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I'd never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling. It seemed to me that I was hearing the very voice of God."

Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. And that's the day I knew there was this entire life behind things, and... this incredibly benevolent force, that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid, ever. Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember... and I need to remember... Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it, like my heart's going to cave in."

I'm almost completely indifferent as to whether Evelyn knows I'm having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her closest friend. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs; tonight I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than the drug use, though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, the biggest dufus in the business."
429,american psycho,"Paul Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstram. It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have a slightly better haircut."

546,austin powers: international man of mystery,"The details of my life are quite inconsequential... very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds- pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it's breathtaking- I highly suggest you try it."
547,austin powers: international man of mystery,"Well my friend Sweet Jay took me to that video arcade in town, right, and they don't speak English there, so Jay got into a fight and he's all, ""Hey quit hasslin' me cuz' I don't speak French"" or whatever! And then the guy said something in Paris talk, and I'm like, ""Just back off!"" And they're all, ""Get out!"" And we're like, ""Make me!"" It was cool."
548,austin powers: international man of mystery,"I like to see girls of that... caliber.  By ""caliber,"" of course, I refer to both the size of their gun barrels and the high quality of their characters... Two meanings... caliber... it's a homonym... Forget it."

555,austin powers: international man of mystery,Does that make you HORNY?
556,austin powers: international man of mystery,"Shall we shag now, or shall we shag later? How do you like to do it? Do you like to wash up first? You know, top and tails... whore's bath? Personally, before I'm on the job, I like to give my undercarriage a bit of a 'how's your father'!"

574,avatar,They're not gonna give up their home. They're not gonna make a deal.  For-for what? A light beer and blue jeans? There's nothing that we have that they want. Everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time. They're never gonna leave Hometree.

646,barton fink,"Think about it, Fink! Writers come and go; we always need Indians!"
647,barton fink,"Me I just enjoy making things up. Yessah escape. Its when I can't write I can't escape myself, I want to rip my head off and run screaming down the street with my balls in a fruit pickers pail."
648,barton fink,"The doctor, what's he gonna tell me? Can't trade my head in for a new one."
649,barton fink,"Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a roadmap?"
650,barton fink,"Mister Fink, they have not invented a genre of picture that Bill Mayhew has not, at one time or other, been invited to essay. Yes, I have taken my stab at the rasslin' form, as I have stabbed at so many others, and with as little success. I gather that you are a freshman here, eager for an upperclassman's counsel. However, just at the moment, I have drinking to do. Why don't you stop by my bungalow, which is number fifteen, later on this afternoon, and we will discuss rasslin' scenarios and other things lit'rary."
651,barton fink,"You're a sick fuck, Fink."
652,barton fink,"That son of a bitch! Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer..."
653,barton fink,Sex? He's a man! We wrestled!
654,barton fink,"Yeah... Ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smokescreen for demanding it back with interest."
655,barton fink,"Okay Fink, let's chow."
656,basic,All we got to do is tell the story right.
657,basic,"Three things, first you don't have a choice, second i've never taken a bribe in my life, and third... i'm still a little drunk from earlier so if I skip over the witty banter and move straight on to coming on to you I hope you don't take offense."
658,basic,You think you know everything? You haven't even scratched the surface.
659,basic instinct,"You got goddamned Tweety Birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got! You think you can fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after? Aw, man!"
660,basic instinct,"What was I supposed to say? ""Hey, guys, I'm not gay, but I did fuck your suspect""?"
661,basic instinct,What is this? Some kind of JOKE?
662,basic instinct,Killing isn't like smoking. You can stop.
663,basic instinct,"You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?"
664,basic instinct,Everyone that she plays with dies.
665,basic instinct,"Let me ask you something, Rocky, man to man. I think she's the fuck of the century, what do you think?"
666,basquiat,"That's $2000 and he's from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, suck my pussy, you star!"
667,batman,Gentlemen! Let's broaden our minds. Lawrence?
668,batman,New and improved Joker products! With a new secret ingredient: Smylex.
669,batman,This is Commissioner Gordon! I want him taken alive! I repeat: Any man who opens fire on Jack Napier will answer to me!
670,batman,"Let him go, or I'll do Gordon."
671,batman forever,"Now, you can be a part of the action. Witness the entertainment in your living room.  The Box, in every home in America, and one day, the world."
672,batman forever,I guess we're all two people.
673,batman forever,"Batman? Batman, you say? Coming for you?  I'm... COUNTING ON IT!"
674,batman forever,Your entrance was good... his was better. The difference: showmanship.
675,batman forever,Let's see if you bleed green.
676,batman forever,This is your brain on the box. This is my brain on the box. Does anybody else feel like a fried egg?
677,batman forever,Has anybody ever told you you have a SERIOUS IMPULSE-CONTROL PROBLEM?
678,batman forever,"Is the young master leaving? Pity. I'll just toss this away, then. Perhaps the dogs are hungry."
679,batman returns,"Honey, I'm home. Oh, I forgot. I'm not married."
680,batman returns,"You didn't invite me, so I CRASHED!"
681,batman returns,"I'm not big on speeches, so I'd just like to say: thanks."
682,batman returns,Let me guess... trust fund goody-goody?
683,batman returns,"Maybe this is a bad time to mention this, but my license has expired!"
684,batman returns,"I don't know about you, Miss Kitty, but I feel so much yummier."
685,batman returns,Why are you now determined to prove that this Penguin is not what he seems? Must you be the only lonely man-beast in town?
686,batman returns,"True. I was their number one son, and they treated me like number two."
687,batman returns,"Sir, shall we change the channel to a program with some dignity and class? The Love Connection, perhaps?"
688,batman returns,"I believe the word you're looking for is ""Aaahh""!"
689,batman returns,"It's the so-called ""normal"" guys who always let you down. Sickos never scare me. Least they're committed."
690,batman returns,I am Catwoman. Hear me roar.
691,batman returns,Why is their always someone who brings eggs and tomatoes to a speech?
692,batman returns,"You know what, I mistook me for somebody else."
693,batman returns,Please. I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
694,batman returns,"Well, the party never stops on Selina Kyle's answering machine..."
695,batman returns,"Actually, this is all just a bad dream. You're at home, in bed, heavily sedated, resting comfortably, dying from the carcinogens you personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice, you tell me."
696,batman returns,"Just relax. I'll take care of the squealing, wretched, pinhead puppets of Gotham!"
697,batman returns,"They wouldn't put me on a pedestal, so I'm layin' 'em on a slab!"
698,batman returns,"But when it comes down to it, who's holding the umbrella?"
699,batman returns,"The tree lights up, and then I push the button. No-no, wait, wait, wait, wait. I press the button and *then* the tree lights up..."
700,batman returns,How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
701,batman returns,You gotta admit I played this stinkin' city like a harp from hell.
702,batman returns,"I may have saved the mayor's baby, but I refuse to save a mayor who stood by helpless *as a baby*, while Gotham City was ravaged by a disease that turned eagle scouts into crazed clowns and happy homemakers into catwomen!"
703,batman returns,You poor guys. Always confusing your pistols with your privates.
704,batman returns,"I could really get into this mayor stuff. It's not about power, it's about reaching out to people - touching people - groping people!"
705,batman returns,Our research tells us that voters like fingers.
706,battle los angeles,Maybe I can help. I'm a veterinarian.

711,beavis and butt-head do america,"Well, I'll be a monkey's bare-assed uncle."
712,beavis and butt-head do america,Cut it out butt-hole!
713,beavis and butt-head do america,I am the great Cornholio. I need T.P. for my bunghole.
714,beavis and butt-head do america,Why does everybody want to see my schlong?
715,beavis and butt-head do america,"Hey, Beavis, check it out. I'm jacking off."
716,beavis and butt-head do america,You must bow down to the almighty bunghole!
717,beavis and butt-head do america,This is the coolest thing I have ever seen.
718,beavis and butt-head do america,"Whoa, cool. Hey, can I have a gun, too?"
719,beavis and butt-head do america,"Agent Hurly, I want you to give this scumbag a cavity search. I'm talking Roto-Rooter. Don't stop until you reach the back of his teeth."
720,beavis and butt-head do america,Yoohoo! Travis and Bob Head! Hello!
721,beetle juice,Nice building... bad roof... goooood parking.
722,beetle juice,What's the good of being a ghost if you can't frighten people away.
723,beetle juice,We've come for your daughter Chuck.
724,beetle juice,Delia hates it.  I could live here.
725,beetle juice,"Oh, Adam! We're trapped in this house with those people!"
726,beetle juice,"Mom, Dad. I just want you two to know, you're welcome at our house anytime you want to come over. In the meantime, the dowry's on me, dad."
727,beetle juice,Go ahead... make my millenium.
728,beetle juice,Number fifty-four million six hundred and one... Ferndoch.
729,beetle juice,Ugh. Deliver me from L.L. Bean.
730,being john malkovich,"Oh, what magic those fingers could work on the right cabinet! Maybe you could alphabetize me. And remember, 'I' comes before 'U'."
731,being john malkovich,"Hey Malkovich, think fast!"
732,being john malkovich,"You're not someone I could get interested in, Craig, you play with dolls."
733,being john malkovich,Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
734,being john malkovich,Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man.
735,being john malkovich,"Have you ever had two people look at you, with complete lust and devotion, through the same pair of eyes?"
736,being john malkovich,What happens when a man goes through his own portal?
737,being john malkovich,J.M. Inc.: Be all that someone else can be.
738,being john malkovich,"Craig, I don't find you attractive, but Lotte, I'm smitten with you. I am... but only when you're in Malkovich. When I was with him last night, I was looking into his eyes and could sense your feminine longing."
739,being john malkovich,"Here's the thing: If you ever get me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me."
740,being john malkovich,"Truth is for suckers, Johnny Boy."
741,being john malkovich,"You're nuts to let a girl go that calls you Lotte, I tell you that as a friend."
742,being there,"It's for sure a white man's world in America. Look here: I raised that boy since he was the size of a piss-ant. And I'll say right now, he never learned to read and write. No, sir. Had no brains at all. Was stuffed with rice pudding between th' ears. Shortchanged by the Lord, and dumb as a jackass. Look at him now! Yes, sir, all you've gotta be is white in America, to get whatever you want. Gobbledy-gook!"
743,being there,That was a very small room.
744,being there,"Now move, honky, before I cut your white ass."
745,beloved,A Nigger. If that don't beat all.
746,beloved,"I got a tree on my back and a haint in my house, and nothing inbetween but the daughter I'm holding in my arms."
747,beloved,"You got two feet, Sethe, not four."
748,beloved,"We have a ghost here, you know?"
749,big,"Hey Angel, get out of that bathroom now."
750,big,I'd use the chain if I were you.
751,big,"The space goes down, down baby, down, down the roller coaster. Sweet, sweet baby, sweet, sweet, don't let me go. Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa pop. Shimmy, shimmy, rock. Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa pop. Shimmy, shimmy, rock. I met a girlfriend - a triscuit. She said, a triscuit - a biscuit. Ice cream, soda pop, vanilla on the top. Ooh, Shelly's out, walking down the street, ten times a week. I read it. I said it. I stole my momma's credit. I'm cool. I'm hot. Sock me in the stomach three more times."
752,big,"Got it, got it, need it, got it..."
753,big fish,"It occurred to me then, that perhaps the reason for my growth was I was intended for larger things. After all, a giant man can't have an ordinary-sized life."
754,big fish,"""The milkman just dropped dead on the porch."" Because see, my mother was banging the milkman."
755,big fish,"I was thinking about death and all. About seeing how you're gonna die. I mean, on one hand, if dying was all you thought about, it could kind of screw you up. But it could kind of help you, couldn't it? Because you'd know that everything else you can survive."
756,big fish,"Dad, I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact."
757,big fish,"Truth is, I've always been thirsty."
758,big fish,Have you ever heard a joke so many times you've forgotten why it's funny? And then you hear it again and suddenly it's new. You remember why you loved it in the first place.
759,big fish,"You were a big fish in a small pond, but this here is the ocean and your drownin'. Take my advice, go back to Puddleville; you'll be happy there."
760,big fish,"He's almost a stranger, and I prefer him to you!"
761,big fish,She'll make soap out of you. That's what she does. She makes soap out of people.
762,big fish,"I was the biggest thing Ashton had ever seen. Until one day, a stranger arrived."
763,big fish,"They say when you meet the love of your life, time stops, and that's true. What they don't tell you is that when it starts again, it moves extra fast to catch up."
764,big fish,This isn't how I die.
765,big fish,I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
766,big fish,"There's a time when a man needs to fight, and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny is lost... the ship has sailed and only a fool would continue. Truth is... I've always been a fool."
767,big fish,"In telling the story of my father's life, it's impossible to separate fact from fiction, the man from the myth. The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me. It doesn't always make sense and most of it never happened... but that's what kind of story this is."
768,big fish,"It's rude to talk about religion, you never know who you're gonna offend."
769,big fish,There comes a point when any reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he made a mistake. The truth is... I was never a reasonable man.
770,big fish,"Sandra Templeton, I love you and I WILL marry you."
771,big fish,"Sometimes, the only way to catch an uncatchable woman is to offer her a wedding ring."
772,big fish,"That was my father's final joke, I guess. A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories. They live on after him. And in that way he becomes immortal."
773,big fish,"I've been nothin' but myself since the day I was born, and if you can't see that it's your failin', not mine."
774,big fish,We have to take Glenville to avoid the church traffic because the damn church people drive too slow.
775,big fish,I don't think I'll ever dry out.
776,big fish,"With my prospects few, I took a job as a traveling salesman. It suited me. If there's one thing you can say about Edward Bloom, it's that I'm a social person."
777,big fish,You become what you always were - a very big fish.
778,big fish,"It was that night I discovered that most things you consider evil or wicked are simply lonely, and lacking in the social niceties."
779,birthday girl,I'll give you a tune later.
780,black snake moan,"I think... I think we're fucked up. I know I am. But that don't mean what I feel ain't real, that I can't love somebody. And I know what I done is real real bad, but um...  So if you want to quit on me I understand. But please don't."
781,black snake moan,I'm cookin' steaks fah dinnah. I expect you to stay.
782,black snake moan,"Why you old men gotta talk so much? You gotta talk yourself into fucking me? Like little boys. It's okay. I'm grown, I know. We can go slow.  You gonna give me another bath?"
783,black snake moan,"Cain slew Able, slew him out of envy. God put his mark on Cain for his sins, is that what you want Deke? Huh? Is that what you come here for? I'll do it for you, all you got to do is say it again... Say you love me.  SAY YOU LOVE ME NIGGA!"
784,black snake moan,God put you in my path and I aim to cure you of your wicked ways.
785,blade,"There's a war going on out there. Blade, myself, a few others, we've tried to keep it from spilling over onto the streets. Sometimes people like yourself get caught in the cross fire."
786,blade,Remember what we told you. You keep your eyes open. They're everywhere.
787,blade,You may wake up one day and find yourself extinct.
788,blade,"Wander off the beaten path, Doctor."
789,blade,"You know, my mother used to say: A cold heart is a dead heart."
790,blade,Christ! I'm too old for this! Somebody get me a goddamn wheelchair!
791,blade ii,Vampires... I hate vampires...
792,blade ii,Is the enemy of my enemy my friend or my enemy?
793,blade ii,"There's an old saying: Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer."
794,blade ii,"If there's anything left of you in there, Whistler, listen up. In the morning those blinds are going to open. Whether you're cured or not."
795,blade ii,"Well, you didn't think I forgot about you, did you?"
796,blade runner,"I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on Moral Abuses."
797,blade runner,"We need you, Sebastian. You're our best and only friend."
798,blade runner,Wake up! Time to die!
799,blade runner,"Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you were supposed to be good. Aren't you the ""good"" man? C'mon, Deckard. Show me what you're made of."
800,blade runner,"We're not computers, Sebastian, we're physical."
801,blade runner,That was irrational of you... not to mention unsportsmanlike.
802,blade runner,"I think, Sebastian, therefore I am."
803,blade runner,Nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch!
804,blade trinity,"She's making playlists. She likes to listen to MP3s when she hunts. It's like her own internal soundtrack, you know? Dark core, trip-hop, whatever kids are listening to these days. Me, I'm more of a David Hasselhof fan, you know?"
805,blade trinity,"I picked Danica up in a bar, and spent the next five years playing hide-and-go-suck as her little vampire cabana boy. Eventually, Abigail found me, Sommerfield managed to treat me with a cure, and now I kill them. And that's basically turning a frown upside down."
806,blade trinity,What do you get when you cross a vampire with a werewolf? You get a fur coat that sticks to your neck!
807,blade trinity,"Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Where're you going?  Where the fuck is he going? This is supposed to be a rescue!"
808,blade trinity,"You know the kind of woman that just screams trouble? You see her, and every warning bell in your brain starts going off, but you still manage to ask for her number? Well, that's all I ever hook up with. But this betty... whoa! She blew them all away in the shitstorm sweepstakes."
809,blade trinity,And this walking diaper stain is Jarko Grimwood.
810,blade trinity,Are you ready to die... motherfucker?
811,blade trinity,"Kill one man, you're a murderer, kill a million, a king. Kill them all, a God."
812,blade trinity,Don't you know that fur is murder?
813,blood simple,He was alive when I buried him.
814,blood simple,"Let's do it outside, in nature."
815,blood simple,"And remember, gentlemen, we're always here, two to two, A.M. to P.M., three hundred and sixty-four days and Christmas, God willing and the creek don't rise."
816,blood simple,"The world is full o' complainers. An' the fact is, nothin' comes with a guarantee. Now I don't care if you're the pope of Rome, President of the United States or Man of the Year; somethin' can all go wrong. Now go on ahead, y'know, complain, tell your problems to your neighbor, ask for help, 'n watch him fly. Now, in Russia, they got it mapped out so that everyone pulls for everyone else... that's the theory, anyway. But what I know about is Texas, an' down here... you're on your own."
817,blood simple,"JEEEE-zus, I've got a hangover... ... you wanta drink?"
818,blood simple,"Look. Personally I don't give a shit. I know Marty's a hard-on but you gotta do something. I don't know; give the money back, say you're sorry, or get the fuck out of here, or something... It's very humiliating, preaching about this shit... I'm not laughing at this, Ray Bob, so you know it's no fucking joke."
819,blood simple,Gimme a call whenever you wanna cut off my head. I can always crawl around without it.
820,blood simple,Who looks stupid now?
821,blood simple,"You know, you know, a friend of mine a while back broke his hand and put it in a cast. Very next day, he falls, protects his bad hand, and he breaks his good one. So he breaks it too, you know. So, now he's got two busted flippers. So, I says to him: ""Creighton,"" I says. ""I hope your wife really loves you, because for the next five weeks, you can't even wipe your own god damn ass.""  That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love."
822,blow,You failed because you had the wrong dream... What do you know about cocaine?
823,blow,"Man, you don't know dick about smugglin' no drugs!"
824,blow,I thought you couldn't live without your heart.
825,blow,I was busted. Set up by the FBI and the DEA. That didn't bother me. Set up by Kevin Dulli and Derek Forreal to save their own asses. That didn't bother me. Sentenced to 60 years at Ottisville. That didn't bother me. I'd broken a promise. Everything I love in my life goes away.
826,blue velvet,I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm in the middle of a mystery and it's all secret.
827,blue velvet,I looked for you in my closet tonight.
828,blue velvet,Hold me. I'm falling! I'm falling! Hold me.
829,blue velvet,Why are there people like Frank?
830,blue velvet,Suave! Goddamn you're one suave fucker!
831,blue velvet,It's a strange world.
832,blue velvet,"Hey neighbour! You shit-for-brains, man! You forgot I have a police radio!"
833,blue velvet,Don't you fucking look at me!
834,blue velvet,"Don't be a good neighbor to her. I'll send you a love letter,  straight from my heart, fucker! You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet from a fucking gun, fucker! You receive a love letter from me, you're fucked forever! You understand, fuck? I'll send you straight to hell, fucker!"
835,blue velvet,He put his disease in me.
836,blue velvet,Do you like the way I feel?
837,blue velvet,Let's fuck! I'll fuck anything that moves!
838,body heat,"Well, some men, once they get a whiff of it, they trail you like a hound."
839,body heat,"Mr. Racine, the next time you come into my courtroom I hope you've got either a better defense, or a better class of client."
840,body heat,"I got a serious question for you: What the fuck are you doing? This is not shit for you to be messin' with. Are you ready to hear something? I want you to see if this sounds familiar: any time you try a decent crime, you got fifty ways you're gonna fuck up. If you think of twenty-five of them, then you're a genius... and you ain't no genius. You remember who told me that?"
841,body heat,"I'm really disappointed in you, Racine. I've been living vicariously off of you for years. You shut up on me now, all I have is my wife."
842,body heat,Sometimes the shit comes down so heavy I feel like I should wear a hat.
843,body of evidence,"It gets easier, doesn't it Frank?"
844,body of evidence,I don't know why men lie; they just do. Men. Lie.
845,bodyguard,"I don't trust discipline. I know, at that crucial moment, I'd cop out."
846,bodyguard,What are you looking at? You've probably never had a heavy night in your whole damn disciplined life.
847,bodyguard,"The people who hire me, they don't have to be convinced to save their own lives."
848,bodyguard,They don't wash cars on the upper level.
849,bones,"Jimmy Bones, is that you? I thought we killed you..."

853,bonfire of the vanities,"Sherman, I'm coming from the South and I'm starting to not like this!"
854,bonfire of the vanities,Sherman... where are all the white people?
855,bonfire of the vanities,"This is a tragedy! A fine young man has been struck down. God- fearing, church-going, never in trouble, graduating from high school, ready for college - and somebody comes along - some rich white people in a rich white man's car and wham! They run him down and never even stop. Now what are we going to do about these parking tickets?"
856,bonfire of the vanities,"Maria, you're incorrigible!"
857,bonnie and clyde,"Hell, you might just be the best damn girl in Texas."
858,bonnie and clyde,This here's Miss Bonnie Parker. I'm Clyde Barrow. We rob banks.
859,bonnie and clyde,"Why don't y'all go back to your *own* cabin, if you want to play with C.W."
860,bonnie and clyde,Your advertising's just dandy... folks would never guess you don't have a thing to sell.
861,bonnie and clyde,"Well why not? I earned my share same as everybody. Well, I coulda got killed same as everybody. And I'm wanted by the law same as everybody... I'm a nervous wreck and that's the truth. I have to take sass from Miss Bonnie Parker all the time. I deserve mine."
862,bonnie and clyde,"There's nothing wrong with me, I mean I don't like boys."
863,bonnie and clyde,"You're just like your brother. Ignorant, uneducated hillbilly, except the only special thing about you is your peculiar ideas about love-making, which is no love-making at all."
864,bonnie and clyde,"We got a dollar ninety-eight, and you're laughing!"
865,bonnie and clyde,"...the truck drivers come in to eat greasy burgers and they kid you and you kid them back, but they're stupid and dumb, boys with big tattoos all over 'em, and you don't like it... And they ask you for dates and sometimes you go... but you mostly don't, and all they ever try is to get into your pants whether you want to or not... and you go home and sit in your room and think, when and how will I ever get away from this?... And now you know."

870,bound,"We make our own choices, we pay our own prices."
871,bound,Either pull the trigger or get that fucking thing out of my face.
872,bound,I have this image of you - inside of me - like a part of me.
873,bound,"When you get tired of Cagney and Lacey, find me."

880,braveheart,"I hope you've washed your ass this morning, it's about to be kissed by a king."
881,braveheart,The king will be dead in a month and his son is a weakling. Who do you think will rule this kingdom?
882,braveheart,Who is this person who speaks to me as though I needed his advice?
883,braveheart,"First, learn to use  this. Then I'll teach you to use  this."
884,braveheart,"God tells me he can get me out of this mess, but he's pretty sure you're fucked."
885,braveheart,"Lower your flags and march straight back to England, stopping at every home you pass by to beg forgiveness for a hundred years of theft, rape, and murder. Do that and your men shall live. Do it not, and every one of you will die today."

892,braveheart,"You see? Death comes to us all. But before it comes to you, know this: your blood dies with you. A child who is not of your line grows in my belly. Your son will not sit long on the throne. I swear it."

894,braveheart,"Before we let you leave, your commander must cross that field, present himself before this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own arse."
895,braveheart,There's a difference between us. You think the people of this country exist to provide you with position. I think your position exists to provide those people with freedom. And I go to make sure that they have it.
896,braveheart,"We all end up dead, it's just a question of how and why."
897,brazil,This is your receipt for your husband... and this is my receipt for your receipt.
898,brazil,Mistakes? We don't make mistakes.
899,brazil,"All you've got to do is blow your nose and it's fixed, in't it?"
900,brazil,Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seem to have forgotten good old-fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game...
901,brazil,What have you done with his body?
902,brazil,"Where'd you get this from, eh? Out yer nostril?"
903,brazil,Yes... No... I don't know. I don't know what I want.
904,brazil,"We're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game."
905,brazil,Just me and my little knife! Snip snip - slice slice... can you believe it?
906,brazil,Jill? Yes... Sam I think I ought to tell you. I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavillion. Thrown in the towel.
907,brazil,"Mr. Lowry, can you wait in reception? You're giving her wrinkles."
908,brazil,My good friends call me Harry.
909,brazil,"Bloody typical, they've gone back to metric without telling us."
910,brazil,Care for a little necrophilia? Hmmm?
911,brazil,"Sorry, I'm a bit of a stickler for paperwork. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?"
912,brazil,"I assure you, Mrs. Buttle, the Ministry is very scrupulous about following up and eradicating any error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms."

917,brick,Come to see the show?
918,brick,You better be sure you wanna know what you wanna know.

921,brick,"No more of these informal chats! If you have a disciplinary issue with me, write me up or suspend me and I'll see you at the Parent-Teacher conference."
922,brick,"She nearly shook me upside down. Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but why'd she come to me?"
923,brick,You did good Brain. Go sleep.
924,brick,"No, bulls would gum it. They'd flash their dusty standards at the wide-eyes and probably find some yegg to pin, probably even the right one. But they'd trample the real tracks and scare the real players back into their holes, and if we're doing this I want the whole story. No cops, not for a bit."
925,brick,"She just sprung it on me, just...  It's a hell of a thing to spring on a guy. I don't remember much, Laura talked me down after, said whatever... she knew her, said it wasn't true, but I still think sometimes... think about it being true... about it being mine. Maybe I did it 'cause I thought it was true. It's a hell of a thing."
926,brick,Maybe I'll just sit here and bleed at you.

931,bringing out the dead,"Saving someone's life is like falling in love. The best drug in the world. For days, sometimes weeks afterwards, you walk the streets, making infinite whatever you see. Once, for a few weeks, I couldn't feel the earth - everything I touched became lighter. Horns played in my shoes. Flowers fell from my pockets. You wonder if you've become immortal, as if you've saved your own life as well. God has passed through you. Why deny it, that for a moment there - why deny that for a moment there, God was you?"
932,bringing out the dead,"The first step is love, the second is mercy."
933,bringing out the dead,66-Exterminator here. We like our coffee bloody!

1027,casino,"The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse. And so did the powers that be."

You motherfucker, you."
1031,casino,"Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out. Get out! Go on. Let's go."
1032,casino,"For two days and two fuckin' nights, we beat the shit out of this guy. I mean, we even stuck ice-picks in his balls."
1033,casino,"I don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?"
1034,casino,"You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table? You shit-kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you. You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert."
1035,casino,Can you feel my eyes on you? Can you feel me look into your heart? Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach? Can you feel me in you? In your heart?
1036,casino,"Normally, my prospects of coming back alive from a meeting with Nicky were 99 out of 100. But this time, when I heard him say ""a couple of hundred yards down the road"", I gave myself 50-50."
1037,casino,"Back home, they would have put me in jail for what I'm doing. Here, they're giving me awards."
1038,casino,"For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking wild west."
1039,casino,"Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here: the right way, the wrong way, and the way that *I* do it. You understand?"
1040,casino,That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
1041,casino,"In the casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing and to keep them coming back. The longer they play, the more they lose, and in the end, we get it all."
1042,casino,"Tell that fuckin' Pepe if he's switching stones on us, he'd better take a fucking camel back to Nigeria."
1043,casino,"Now, notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything. Somehow, somebody's always lookin' the other way. Now, look at these guys. They look busy, right? They're countin' money. Who wants to bother them? I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal."
1044,casino,"When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, I believed, that's the kind of love I had."
1045,casino,What's he doing? He knows those guys he yelled at are friends of ours. What's the matter with him? Making all this mess!
1046,casino,I'm what counts out here. Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows. And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?
1047,casino,"Look at this fuckin beaut they put in now. Sherbert send you in here to rob me now? Been fucking knocking everyone's dick in all night? Huh, you been beating all the customers tonight, motherfucker? Huh? Jag-off. Hit me."
1048,casino,"Now, on top of everything else, I gotta make sure no one fucks around with the Golden Jew."
1049,casino,"She was doing pretty good with her lawsuit. But before she could start counting her money, the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court instead. So they sent me."
1050,casino,"I want you to exit this guy off the premises, I want you to exit him off his feet and I want you to use his head to open the fucking door."
1051,casino,"You hear a little girl, Frankie? Is that a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl? What happened to the fuckin' tough guy who told my friend to stick it up his fuckin' ass?"
1052,casino,"If a guy fucking tripped over a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it."
1053,casino,"Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger's side. But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew, was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat. It's the only thing that saved my life."
1054,casino,"Peek-a-boo, you fucks, you!"
1055,casino,"I think in all fairness, I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do. For instance tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and... walk in and see and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll... crack your fuckin' head wide-open in front of everybody in the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma. And guess what? I'll split your fuckin' head open again. 'Cause I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail. That's my business. That's what I do."
1056,casino,How the fuck can you grin?
1057,casino,"Fuckin' bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' trippa and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop."
1058,casino,That black book's a joke. It's only got two names in it for the whole country. And one of them's still Al Capone.
1059,casino,"Give yourself a hand, right across your fucking mouth."
1060,casino,"You fucking mo-mo, what's the matter with you?"
1061,casino,"No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And if you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead."
1062,casino,"A lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. But you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise, you're talking about a half-hour to forty-five minutes worth of digging. And who knows who's gonna come along in that time? Pretty soon, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night."
1063,casino,"You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off? Huh? And you didn't gamble that fuckin' money? You're gonna stand here and tell me that?"
1064,casino,Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass!
1065,casino,"Me? Thats why The Bosses sent me out here - they wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' ballonheads over here. They were gonna try to bang us outta two hundred fuckin' grand? Yeah, right, I'm sure."
1066,casino,"Nicky's methods of betting weren't scientific, but they worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. I mean, what were they going to do, muscle Nicky? Nicky was the muscle."
1067,catch me if you can,"Ah, people only know what you tell them, Carl."
1068,catch me if you can,"Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned. The second mouse, wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out. Gentlemen, as of this moment, I am that second mouse."

1070,catwoman,"White Russian, no ice, no vodka... hold the Kahlua."
1071,catwoman,Amateurs! You boys thought you could come in here and steal all these beautiful things? What a purrrfect idea!

She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl."

1315,dances with wolves,"Turned injun, didn't yeh."
1316,dances with wolves,"It was hard to know how to feel. I had never been in a battle like this one. This had not been a fight for territory or riches or to make men free. This battle had no ego. It had been fought to preserve the food stores that would see us through winter, to protect the lives of women and children and loved ones only a few feet away. I felt a pride I had never felt before."

1343,dead poets society,"Next time I see you, you die."
1344,dead poets society,"We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, ""O me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless... of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?"" Answer. That you are here - that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play *goes on* and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?"

1348,dead poets society,"They're not that different from you, are they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones, just like you. Invincible, just like you feel. The world is their oyster. They believe they're destined for great things, just like many of you, their eyes are full of hope, just like you. Did they wait until it was too late to make from their lives even one iota of what they were capable? Because, you see gentlemen, these boys are now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen real close, you can hear them whisper their legacy to you. Go on, lean in. Listen, you hear it? - - Carpe - - hear it? - - Carpe, carpe diem, seize the day boys, make your lives extraordinary."

And yet, Keyes, as I was walking down the street to the drugstore, suddenly, it came over me that everything would go wrong. It sounds crazy Keyes, but it's true, so help me, I couldn't hear my own footsteps. It was the walk of a dead man."
1481,double indemnity,"Now look, Walter. A guy takes out an accident policy that's worth $100,000 if he's killed on the train. Then, two weeks later, he *is* killed on the train. And, not from the train accident, mind you, but falling off some silly observation car. You know what the mathematical probability of that is? One out of, oh, I don't know how many billions. And after that, the broken leg. No, it just, it just can't be the way it looks. Something has been worked on us!"

1692,fargo,But you're sayin'... what are ya sayin'?
1693,fargo,"Ah, hon, ya got Arby's all over me."
1694,fargo,"OK, so we got a trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, these folks drive by, there's a high-speed pursuit, ends here and then this execution-type deal."
1695,fargo,"I'm not talking about your damn word, Jerry."
1696,fargo,How was everything today?
1697,fast times at ridgemont high,I think I just came... didn't you feel it?
1698,fast times at ridgemont high,"You are a wuss: part wimp, and part pussy."
1699,fast times at ridgemont high,"Hey, wait a minute, there's no birthday party for me here!"
1700,fast times at ridgemont high,"Awesome! Totally awesome! All right, Hamilton!"
1701,fast times at ridgemont high,"What do you mean, better in bed? Either you do it or you don't."
1702,fast times at ridgemont high,"Hope you had a hell of a piss, Arnold!"
1703,fast times at ridgemont high,"I can see it all now, this is gonna be just like last summer. You fell in love with that girl at the Fotomat, you bought forty dollars worth of fuckin' film, and you never even talked to her. You don't even own a camera."
1704,fast times at ridgemont high,Aloha. My name is Mr. Hand.
1705,fast times at ridgemont high,"Brad, your sister's turning into a fox!"
1706,fast times at ridgemont high,"This is U.S. History, I see the globe right there."
1707,fast times at ridgemont high,That kid's been stoned since the third grade
1708,fast times at ridgemont high,Jeez. Doesn't anyone fucking knock any more?
1709,fatal instinct,"You stay away from my wife, my life, my home, and my skunk!"
1710,fatal instinct,What are you gonna do? Blow me away?
1711,fatal instinct,"You really are incredibly stupid, aren't you? I like that in a man."
1712,fear and loathing in las vegas,It's okay. He's just admiring the shape of your skull.
1713,fear and loathing in las vegas,All energy flows according to the whims of the Great Magnet. What a fool I was to defy him.
1714,fear and loathing in las vegas,Did they pay you to screw that bear?
1715,fear and loathing in las vegas,"There's one thing you should probably understand... *Can you hear me?* Good. I want you to have all the background. This is a very ominous assignment, with overtones of extreme personal danger. I'm a Doctor of Journalism! This is important, goddammit! This is a fucking true story!"
1716,fear and loathing in las vegas,"That'll blast you right through the wall. You'll be stone dead in ten seconds. Shit, they'll make me explain things!"
1717,fear and loathing in las vegas,"There he goes. One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die."
1718,fear and loathing in las vegas,"That bastard isn't gonna get away with this. I mean, what is going on in this country when a scumsucker like that can get away with sandbagging a doctor of journalism? Can you tell me that?"
1719,fear and loathing in las vegas,"I'm not really sure I can answer that, but what I can say is that if Margaret Mead, at her age, smoked grass... she'd have one hell of a trip!"
1720,fear and loathing in las vegas,"If I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten his breakfast because he's a very crude man.  Jesus God!"
1721,fear and loathing in las vegas,"I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo, and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things. Won't be long now before they tear us to shreds."
1722,fear and loathing in las vegas,Dogs fucked the Pope... no fault of mine.
1723,fear and loathing in las vegas,Now this was a superior machine. Ten grand worth of gimmicks and high-priced special effects. The rear windows lit up with a touch like frogs in a dynamite pond. The dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters that I would never understand.
1724,fear and loathing in las vegas,A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth. But no one should be asked to handle this trip.
1725,fear and loathing in las vegas,"Yeah, I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime, and I did it anyways. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal, look at me."
1726,fear and loathing in las vegas,"If the pigs were gathering in Vegas, I felt the drug culture should be represented as well. And there was a certain bent appeal in the notion of running a savage burn on one Las Vegas hotel, and then just wheeling across town and checking into another. Me and a thousand ranking cops from all over America. Why not? Move confidently into their midst."
1727,fear and loathing in las vegas,One toke? You poor fool! Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
1728,fear and loathing in las vegas,"I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting the Fear."
1729,fear and loathing in las vegas,Don't take any guff from these fucking swine.
1730,fear and loathing in las vegas,"I'm a relatively respectable citizen. Multiple felon perhaps, but certainly not dangerous."
1731,fear and loathing in las vegas,"You people just don't understand! This car is property of the World Bank, that money goes to Italy!"
1732,fear and loathing in las vegas,"There was only one road back to L.A. - U.S. Interstate 15. Just a flat-out high speed burn through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo. Then onto the Hollywood Freeway, and straight on into frantic oblivion. Safety. Obscurity. Just another freak, in the freak kingdom."
1733,fear and loathing in las vegas,"Shit, he's killing himself!"
1734,fear and loathing in las vegas,"...hamburger stand, she's a waitress about 16 years old. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot. Then they cut all kinds of holes in her and sucked out the blood. They were after the peneal gland I think. Yeah. Nah, how's ya mama?"
1735,fear and loathing in las vegas,"The possibility of physical and mental collapse is now very real. No sympathy for the Devil, keep that in mind. Buy the ticket, take the ride."
1736,fear and loathing in las vegas,"Wear some golf shoes, otherwise we'll never get out of this place alive. Impossible to walk in this muck. No footing at all."
1737,fear and loathing in las vegas,I've never missed a plane yet.
1738,fear and loathing in las vegas,Step right up and shoot the pasties off the nipples of a ten foot bull dyke! Win a cotton candy goat!
1739,fear and loathing in las vegas,"With a bit of luck, his life was ruined forever. Always thinking that just behind some narrow door in all of his favorite bars, men in red woolen shirts are getting incredible kicks from things he'll never know."
1740,fear and loathing in las vegas,"What kind of rat bastard psychotic would play that song right now, at this moment?"
1741,fear and loathing in las vegas,Is this not a reasonable place to park?
1742,fear and loathing in las vegas,Finish the fucking story man! What happened? What about the glands?
1743,fear and loathing in las vegas,Bazooko's Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday nights if the Nazis had won the war. This was the Sixth Reich.
1744,fear and loathing in las vegas,"Jesus, bad waves of paranoia, madness, fear and loathing - intolerable vibrations in this place. Get out. The weasels were closing in. I could smell the ugly brutes."
1745,fear and loathing in las vegas,You drive. You drive. I think there's something wrong with me.
1746,fear and loathing in las vegas,Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas. Two good old boys in a fire-apple red convertible. Stoned. Ripped. Twisted. Good people.
1747,fear and loathing in las vegas,"One of the things you learn from years of dealing with drug people, is that you can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug. Especially when it's waving a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eye."
1748,fear and loathing in las vegas,"My attorney had never been able to accept the notion, often espoused by former drug abusers, that you can get a lot higher without drugs than with them, and neither have I for that matter."
1749,fear and loathing in las vegas,"You people voted for Hubert Humphrey, and you killed Jesus."
1750,fear and loathing in las vegas,We cant stop here this is bat country.
1751,fear and loathing in las vegas,"Those of us that had been up all night were in no mood for coffee and donuts, we wanted strong drink. We were, after all, the absolute cream of the national sporting press."
1752,fear and loathing in las vegas,Our vibrations were getting nasty. But why? Was there no communication in this car? Had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts?
1753,fear and loathing in las vegas,"Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Has it been five years? Six? It seems like a lifetime, the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. But no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time in the world. Whatever it meant."
1754,ferris bueller's day off,"Ferris Bueller, you're my hero."
1755,ferris bueller's day off,"Cameron has never been in love - at least, nobody's ever been in love with him. If things don't change for him, he's gonna marry the first girl he lays, and she's gonna treat him like shit, because she will have given him what he has built up in his mind as the end-all, be-all of human existence. She won't respect him, 'cause you can't respect somebody who kisses your ass. It just doesn't work."
1756,ferris bueller's day off,"Pardon my French, but you're an asshole! Asshole!"
1757,ferris bueller's day off,"You have reached the Coughlin Brothers Mortuary. We're deeply sorry we are not able to come to the phone right now, but if you leave your name and number, we will get back to you as soon as humanly possible."
1758,ferris bueller's day off,"Hey, Cameron. You realize if we played by the rules right now we'd be in gym?"
1759,ferris bueller's day off,Gummi bear? It's been in my pocket; they're real warm and soft.
1760,ferris bueller's day off,"Oh, he's very popular Ed. The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads - they all adore him. They think he's a righteous dude."
1761,ferris bueller's day off,"Excuse me: if whoever was in this house is still in the house, I'd like you to know that I've just called the police. I'd also like to add that I've got my father's gun and a *scorching* case of herpes."
1762,ferris bueller's day off,"Not that I condone fascism, or any -ism for that matter. -Ism's in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an -ism, he should believe in himself. I quote John Lennon, ""I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me."" Good point there. After all, he was the walrus. I could be the walrus. I'd still have to bum rides off people."
1763,ferris bueller's day off,"If anyone needs a day off, it's Cameron. He has a lot of things to sort out before he graduates. Can't be wound up this tight and go to college, his roommate will kill him."
1764,ferris bueller's day off,Peterson home on line one. And watch your mouth this time.
1765,fight club,It must've been Tuesday. He was wearing his cornflower-blue tie.

1768,fight club,You're not getting this back. I consider it asshole tax.
1769,fight club,We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.
1770,fight club,I've got a stomachful of Xanax. I took what was left of a bottle. It might have been too much.
1771,fight club,"Tell him. Tell him, The liberator who destroyed my property has realigned my perceptions."
1772,fight club,You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.
1773,fight club,His name is Robert Paulson.
1774,fight club,"It's just, when you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that's it. That's the last sofa I'm gonna need. Whatever else happens, I've got that sofa problem handled."
1775,fight club,"In the world I see - you are stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life. You'll climb the wrist-thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower. And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn, laying strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of some abandoned superhighway."
1776,fight club,Deja vu - all over again.
1777,fight club,"Go ahead, Cornelius, you can cry."
1778,fight club,"Every evening I died, and every evening I was born again, resurrected."
1779,fight club,"I had it all. Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections, proof they were crafted by the honest, simple, hard-working indigenous peoples of... wherever."
1780,fight club,"When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep... and you're never really awake."
1781,fight club,This is a chemical burn. It will hurt more than you've ever been burned before. You will have a scar.
1782,fight club,"And then, something happened. I let go. Lost in oblivion. Dark and silent and complete. I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom."
1783,fight club,"On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero."
1784,fight club,"Welcome to Fight Club. The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is: you DO NOT talk about Fight Club! Third rule of Fight Club: someone yells ""stop!"", goes limp, taps out, the fight is over. Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas. Sixth rule: No shirts, no shoes. Seventh rule: fights will go on as long as they have to. And the eighth and final rule: if this is your first time at Fight Club, you have to fight."
1785,fight club,This isn't a real suicide-thing. This is probably one of those cry-for-help things.
1786,fight club,Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.
1787,fight club,"You had to give it to him: he had a plan. And it started to make sense, in a Tyler sort of way. No fear. No distractions. The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide."
1788,fight club,"Reject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions."
1789,fight club,"You said that if anyone ever interferes with Project Mayhem, even you, we gotta get his balls."
1790,fight club,"It's called a changeover. The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea."

1792,fight club,Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.
1793,fight club,Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
1794,fight club,Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar. Lord knows what they charged. It was beautiful. We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.
1795,fight club,"We have front row seats for this theatre of mass destruction. The demolitions committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin. In two minutes primary charges will blow base charges and a few square blocks will be reduced to smoldering rubble. I know this, because Tyler knows this."
1796,fight club,You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
1797,fight club,"You don't know where I've been. You don't know where I've been. Just let us have the basement, Lou!"
1798,fight club,"Like so many others, I had become a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct."
1799,fight club,I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
1800,fight club,I've been going to Debtor's Anonymous. You want to see some really fucked-up people...
1801,fight club,"If I didn't say anything, people always assumed the worst."
1802,fight club,"Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room. My parents pulled this exact same act for years."

1810,fight club,"Something on your mind, dear?"
1811,fight club,"Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing. Like the first monkey shot into space."
1812,fight club,"It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee."
1813,fight club,I flipped through catalogs and wondered: What kind of dining set defines me as a person?
1814,fight club,"After fighting, everything else in your life got the volume turned down."
1815,fight club,"When the fight was over, nothing was solved, but nothing mattered. We all felt saved."
1816,fight club,"I got in everyone's hostile little face. Yes, these are bruises from fighting. Yes, I'm comfortable with that. I am enlightened."
1817,fight club,He was full of pep. Must've had his grande-latte enema.
1818,fight club,I am Jack's smirking revenge.
1819,fight club,"Fight Club was the beginning, now it's moved out of the basement, it's called Project Mayhem."
1820,fight club,The things you own end up owning you.
1821,fight club,"God Damn! We just had a near-life experience, fellas."
1822,fight club,"A guy who came to Fight Club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough. After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood."
1823,fight club,We have just lost cabin pressure.
1824,fight club,"Now, a question of etiquette - as I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?"
1825,fight club,I wasn't really dying. I wasn't host to cancer or parasites. I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
1826,fight club,You're the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
1827,fight club,"Don't worry. It's all taken care of, sir."
1828,final destination,"You tried to capitalize but I caught you, you fuck! Yeah, I can beat you. Not forever, but I've got this cabin rigged to beat you now!"
1829,final destination,"In death there are no accidents, no coincidences, no mishaps, and no escapes."
1830,final destination,"There they go, here we stay."
1831,final destination,You got this? No one gets back on board. That's my call!
1832,final destination,"I won't let it happen, okay?"
1833,final destination,And I fucking hated French class!
1834,final destination,I got this feeling... a weird feeling.
1835,final destination,"You already did that by walking off the plane. Now you gotta out when and how it'll come back at you. Play your hunch, Alex. If you think you can get away from it. But beware the risk of cheating the plan, disrespecting the design... could initiate a horrifying fury that would terrorize even the Grim Reaper - and you don't even want to fuck with that MacDaddy."
1836,final destination,"Because of you, I'm still alive.  Thank you."
1837,final destination,You have a responsibility to tell me!
1838,final destination,I knew I shoulda hit on Tammy in the pool that time.
1839,final destination,It depends on which one of us is next.
1840,final destination,Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl!
1841,final destination 2,I know what I have to do to save us. I have to die.
1842,final destination 2,"If it is my time to go and be in heaven with my family, I can accept that."
1843,final destination 2,"Hello, Clear. I've been expecting you."
1844,final destination 2,"Yeah, like, what if we're all getting that ""Diff'rent Strokes"" curse or something?"
1845,final destination 2,There's gonna be a huge accident. Everybody's gonna die!
1846,final destination 2,We're *all* going to die.
1847,final destination 2,"Dead, yet still fresh."
1848,final destination 2,Which means death could be coming for us?
1849,final destination 2,"Ever hear of the ozone layer, asshole?"

1851,finding nemo,I'm having fish tonight.
1852,finding nemo,"Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to them."
1853,finding nemo,"...and the sea cucumber turns to the mollusk and says, ""With fronds like these, who needs anemones?"""
1854,finding nemo,"Kid, if there's anything you need, just ask your auntie Deb. That's me. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister, Flo.  Hi, how are ya? Don't listen to anything my sister says, she's nuts!"
1855,finding nemo,"Something's wrong with you, really."

1859,finding nemo,"Hi there. From my neck of the woods, eh? Sorry if I took a snap at you at one time. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat."
1860,finding nemo,"I'm dead. I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I died, I'm dead."
1861,finding nemo,Hey. You guys made me ink.
1862,finding nemo,"Hey, look. ""Esc-a-pay"". I wonder what that means? That's funny, it's spelled just like the word ""escape."""
1863,finding nemo,"Oh. Intro- Jellyman, offspring. Offspring, Jellyman."
1864,finding nemo,"I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food."

1866,finding nemo,All drains lead to the ocean.
1867,finding nemo,"If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny, and I know funny. I'm a clownfish."
1868,finding nemo,"Oh, it's awesome, Jellyman. The little dudes are just eggs, we leave 'em on a beach to hatch, and then, coo-coo-cachoo, they find their way back to the big ol' blue."
1869,finding nemo,"Uh, Dad, you can let go now."
1870,finding nemo,Of course he wants us to move over there. That's EATING US.
1871,finding nemo,I didn't come this far to be breakfast.
1872,finding nemo,I have to get out of here! I have to find my son! I have to tell him how old sea turtles are!
1873,finding nemo,"He really doesn't mean it, you know! He never even knew his father!"
1874,finding nemo,That's the shortest red light I've ever seen!
1875,finding nemo,"See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles, but you can't really tell, especially when I twirl them like this."

1883,forrest gump,"When I was in China on the All-American Ping Pong team, I just loved playing ping-pong with my Flexolite ping pong paddle."
1884,forrest gump,"Sometimes, I guess there just aren't enough rocks."
1885,forrest gump,"He should not be hitting you, Jenny."
1886,forrest gump,You know it's funny what a young man recollects? 'Cause I don't remember bein' born. I don't recall what I got for my first Christmas and I don't know when I went on my first outdoor picnic. But I do remember the first time I heard the sweetest voice in the wide world.
1887,forrest gump,You can sit here if ya want.
1888,forrest gump,"And cause I was a gazillionaire, and I liked doin it so much, I cut that grass for free."
1889,forrest gump,"Hello. My name's Forrest, Forrest Gump. You want a chocolate?"
1890,forrest gump,"Listen, you promise me something, OK? Just if you're ever in trouble, don't be brave. You just run, OK? Just run away."
1891,forrest gump,"Mama always said, dying was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn't."
1892,forrest gump,"Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice cream.  Lieutenant Dan, ice cream."
1893,forrest gump,I never thanked you for saving my life.
1894,forrest gump,"Yeah, sir, you might want to send a maintenance man over to that office across the way. The lights are off, and they must be looking for a fuse box, 'cause them flashlights, they keep me awake."
1895,forrest gump,"I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan. She tasted like cigarettes."
1896,forrest gump,That boy sure is a runnin' fool!
1897,forrest gump,Mama says they was magic shoes. They could take me anywhere.
1898,forrest gump,Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.

1903,four rooms,We did it right there in the big cauldron.
1904,four rooms,Problem? I haven't got a problem. I've got fucking problems. Plural.
1905,four rooms,"Well, most recently, there's room 309, there's this scary Mexican gangster dude poking his finger in my chest. There's his hooligan kids snapping their fingers at me. There's a putrid, rotting corpse of a dead whore stuck in the springs of the bed. There's rooms blazing afire. There's a big fat needle from God knows where, stuck in my leg, infecting me with God knows what. And finally there's me, walking out the door, right fucking now. Buenas noches."
1906,four rooms,How can I stop talking about something that's so HUGE?
1907,four rooms,"Unfortunately, you don't have the balls to back up the actions of your huge cock."

Later on he had an idea to build a city out of a desert stop-over for GI's on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man, a man of vision and guts. And there isn't even a plaque, or a signpost or a statue of him in that town! Someone put a bullet through his eye. No one knows who gave the order. When I heard it, I wasn't angry; I knew Moe, I knew he was head-strong, talking loud, saying stupid things. So when he turned up dead, I let it go. And I said to myself, this is the business we've chosen; I didn't ask who gave the order, because it had nothing to do with business!"

2126,good will hunting,"You're suspect! Yeah, you! I don't know what your reputation is in this town, but after the shit you tried to pull today you can bet I'll be looking into you. Now the business we have, heretofore, you can speak with my aforementioned attorney. Good day, gentlemen; and until that day comes, keep your ear to the grindstone."
2127,good will hunting,"So this is a Harvard bar, huh? I thought there'd be equations and shit on the wall."
2128,good will hunting,I'm pumped! Let the healing begin!
2129,good will hunting,"You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and he does his whole, ""We'll be cruising at 35,000 feet,"" then he puts the mike down but he forgets to turn it off. Then he turns to the copilot and goes, ""You know, all I could go for right now is a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee."" So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin' up from the back of the plane to tell him the mic's still on, and this guy behind me goes, ""Hey hon, don't forget the coffee!"""
2130,good will hunting,You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you see is every negative thing 10 miles down the road.
2131,good will hunting,"Look - you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way. In twenty years, if you're still livin' here, comin' over to my house to watch the Patriots games, still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. That's not a threat; now, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you."
2132,good will hunting,"I teach this shit, I didn't say I know how to do it."
2133,good will hunting,My boy's wicked smart.
2134,good will hunting,"Hey, let's get off our motha's, afterall, I just got off yours!"
2135,good will hunting,"Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.? That's a tough one, but I'll take a shot. Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never met, never had no problem with, get killed. Now the politicians are sayin', ""Oh, send in the Marines to secure the area"" 'cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some kid from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass. And he comes back to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And, of course, the oil companies used the skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back, of course, and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs, and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So now my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive, so he's got to walk to the fuckin' job interviews, which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he's starvin', 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat, the only blue plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State. So what did I think? I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure fuck it, while I'm at it why not just shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? I could be elected president."
2136,good will hunting,"Do you buy all these books retail or do you send away for, like, a shrink kit that comes with all these volumes included?"
2137,goodfellas,Jimmy was the kind of guy that rooted for bad guys in the movies.
2138,goodfellas,I got enough to worry about getting whacked on the street! I gotta come home for this! I should fucking kill you!
2139,goodfellas,"For a second I thought I was dead. But, when I heard all the noise, I knew they were cops. Only cops talk that way. If they'd been wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a thing. I would've been dead."
2140,goodfellas,One day some of the kids from the neighborhood carried my mother's groceries all the way home. You know why? It was outta respect.
2141,goodfellas,"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster."
2142,goodfellas,Thirty-two hundred dollars he gave me. Thirty-two hundred dollars for a lifetime. It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.
2143,goodfellas,"When they found Carbone in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff it took them three days to thaw him out for the autopsy."
2144,goodfellas,"After awhile, it got to be all normal. None of it seemed like crime. It was more like Henry was enterprising, and that he and the guys were making a few bucks hustling, while all the other guys were sitting on their asses, waiting for handouts. Our husbands weren't brain surgeons, they were blue-collar guys. The only way they could make extra money, real extra money, was to go out and cut a few corners."
2145,goodfellas,"It was revenge for Billy Batts, and a lot of other things. And there was nothing that we could do about it. Batts was a made man, and Tommy wasn't. And we had to sit still and take it. It was among the Italians. It was real greaseball shit. They even shot Tommy in the face so his mother couldn't give him an open coffin at the funeral."
2146,goodfellas,"Hey, you got a phone? Two niggers just stole my truck. You believe that shit, huh? You fuckin' believe that?"

2148,goodfellas,"I know there are women, like my best friends, who would have gotten out of there the minute their boyfriend gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't. I got to admit the truth. It turned me on."
2149,goodfellas,"By the time I grew up, there was thirty billion a year in cargo moving through Idlewild Airport and believe me, we tried to steal every bit of it."
2150,goodfellas,"For us to live any other way was nuts. Uh, to us, those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks and took the subway to work every day, and worried about their bills, were dead. I mean they were suckers. They had no balls. If we wanted something we just took it. If anyone complained twice they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again"

2201,halloween,"I met him, fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no conscience, no understanding; even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year-old child, with this blank, pale, emotionless face and, the blackest eyes... the *devil's* eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... *evil*."

2209,halloween 4: the return of michael myers,"Yeah, the one you're picking up, just thinkin' about him gives me the 'willies.' A decade ago-Halloween night-he murdered sixteen people, maybe more, trying to get to his sister. Nearly got her, too. But his doctor, of all people, shot him six times, then set him on fire. Both of them nearly burned to death. Yeah, I'll be glad to see this one gone. Yes, indeed-dee!"
2210,halloween 4: the return of michael myers,"Six bodies, Sheriff, that's what I have seen! Between here and Ridgemont. An entire filling station in flames! I'm telling you Michael Myers is here, in this town! He's here to kill that little girl and anybody who gets in his way!"

2218,hannah and her sisters,"A week ago I bought a rifle, I went to the store - I bought a rifle! I was gonna, you know, if they told me I had a tumor, I was gonna kill myself. The only thing that might-ve stopped me - MIGHT'VE - is that my parents would be devastated. I would have to shoot them also, first. And then I have an aunt and uncle - you know - it would've been a blood bath."
2219,hannah and her sisters,"You see the whole culture. Nazis, deodorant salesmen, wrestlers, beauty contests, a talk show. Can you imagine the level of a mind that watches wrestling? But the worst are the fundamentalist preachers. Third grade con men telling the poor suckers that watch them that they speak with Jesus, and to please send in money. Money, money, money! If Jesus came back and saw what's going on in his name, he'd never stop throwing up."
2220,hannah and her sisters,I had a great evening; it was like the Nuremberg Trials.
2221,hannah and her sisters,"Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap. Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda or something. Or go to a whorehouse!"
2222,hannah and her sisters,How the hell do I know why there were Nazis? I don't know how the can opener works!
2223,hannah and her sisters,"Naturally I get taken home first. Well, obviously he prefers April. Of course I was so tongue-tied all night. I can't believe I said that about the Guggenheim,. My stupid rollerskating joke. I should never tell jokes. Mom can tell 'em and Hannah, but I kill 'em.  Where did April come up with that stuff about Adolph Loos and terms like ""organic form""?  Well, naturally. She went to Brandeis. But I don't think she knows what she's talking about. Could you believe the way she was calling him David? ""Yes, David. I feel that way, too, David. What a marvelous space, David."" I hate April. She's pushy."
2224,hannah and her sisters,Then at lunch she got drunker and drunker and finally she became Joan Collins!

2233,hard to kill,"How do like this, Vernon? I'd like to kill you so bad I can barely contain myself. But I've been thinking, death is far too merciful a fate for you. So what I'm going to do is put you in prison. A nice petite white boy like you in a federal penitentiary... now let me just put it this way, I don't think you'll be able to remain anal-retentive for very long."
2234,hard to kill,Where's a goddamn cop when you need one?
2235,hard to kill,How does it feel to know you're about to die?

2241,harold and maude,Dreyfus once wrote from Devil's Island that he would see the most glorious birds. Many years later in Brittany he realized they had only been seagulls... For me they will always be - *glorious* birds.

2248,he's just not that into you,I just need you to stop being nice to me unless you're gonna marry me.
2249,heat,Anyone want some pie?

2251,heathers,"Jesus God in Heaven, why'd you have to kill such hot snatch?  It's a joke man. Geez, people are so serious.  Holy Mary who art in Heaven pray for us sinners... so we don't get caught  Another joke."
2252,heathers,You were nothing before you met me. You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn. You were a Bluebird. You were a Brownie. You were a Girl Scout Cookie.
2253,heathers,"Our love is God, let's go get a Slushie."
2254,heathers,"Ah, oh, uh! I like to suck big dicks. Or, uh... Mmmm! Mmmm! I can't get enough of 'em!"

2256,heathers,"Nice guys finish last, I should know."
2257,heathers,If you were happy every day of your life you wouldn't be a human being. You'd be a game-show host.
2258,heathers,"Grow up Heather, bulimia's so '87."
2259,heathers,"Dear Diary, my teen-angst bullshit now has a body count."
2260,heathers,Whether to kill yourself or not is one of the most important decisions a teenager can make.
2261,heathers,"People will look at the ashes of Westerburg and say, ""Now there's a school that self-destructed, not because society didn't care, but because the school was society."" Now that's deep."
2262,heathers,They all want me as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshiped at Westerburg and I'm only a junior.
2263,heathers,"Football season is over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing left to offer the school except for date rapes and AIDS jokes."
2264,heathers,"You wanted to be a member of the most powerful clique in school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing."
2265,heathers,"Intense... grow up. You think I'll drink it just because you call me chicken...? Just gimmie the cup, jerk."
2266,heathers,"Well, fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa?"
2267,heathers,"Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town."
2268,heathers,"Hi, I'm sorry. Technically, I did not kill Heather Chandler, but hey who am I trying to kid, right? I just want my high school to be a nicer place. Amen. Did that sounded bitchy?"
2269,heathers,"Dear Lord, please make sure this never happens to me because I don't think I could handle suicide. Fast, early acceptance into an Ivy League school and please let it be Harvard. Amen."
2270,heathers,"I prayed for the death of Heather Chandler many times and I felt bad everytime I did it but I kept doing it anyway. Now I know you understood everything. Praise Jesus, Hallelujah."
2271,heathers,"Let's pretend I blew up the school... all the schools. Now that you're dead, what are you gonna do with your life?"
2272,heathers,I knew that loose was too noose... uh... noose too loose...
2273,heathers,"It's one thing to want someone out of your life, but it's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup full of liquid drainer."
2274,heathers,Betty Finn was a true friend and I sold her out for a bunch of Swatch dogs and Diet Coke heads. Killing Heather would be like offing the wicked witch of the west... wait east. West! God! I sound like a fucking psycho.
2275,heathers,"Great pate, mom, but I gotta motor if I wanna be ready for that party tonight."
2276,heathers,"It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask ""What's your major?"". I hate that... . So, when you go to college, what subjects do you think you'll study?"
2277,heavenly creatures,All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases. It's all frightfully romantic.
2278,heavenly creatures,We realised why Deborah and I have such extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us and look at us the way they do. It is because we are MAD. We are both stark raving MAD!
2279,heavenly creatures,I think she knows what's going to happen. She doesn't appear to bear us any grudge.
2280,heavenly creatures,"This notion is not a new one but this time it is a definite plan which we intend to carry out. We have worked it out carefully and are both thrilled by the idea. Naturally we feel a trifle nervous, but the pleasure of anticipation is great."
2281,heavenly creatures,We have decided how sad it is for others that they cannot appreciate our genius.
2282,heavenly creatures,Only the best people fight against all obstacles in pursuit of happiness.
2283,heavenly creatures,"My new years resolution is a far more selfish one than last year. It is to make my motto, eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow, you may be dead"

Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or somethin', and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn, as you get older, is there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit, pardon my vulgarity here. Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another. And what you do in life like when you get older is, you pick the layer of bullshit that you prefer and that's your bullshit, so to speak."

2515,interview with the vampire: the vampire chronicles,"Feed on what you will. Rats, chickens, poodles, I'll leave you to it and watch you come around. But just remember, life without me would be even more unbearable."

2517,interview with the vampire: the vampire chronicles,"It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them. You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to it, all too quickly."
2518,interview with the vampire: the vampire chronicles,"Do you know what his soul said to me, without saying a word? 'Let him go', he said 'Let him go'."

2522,interview with the vampire: the vampire chronicles,"In the spring of 1988, I returned to New Orleans, and as soon as I smelled the air, I knew I was home. It was rich, almost sweet, like the scent of jasmine and roses around our old courtyard. I walked the streets, savoring that long lost perfume."
2523,interview with the vampire: the vampire chronicles,"Goodnight sweet prince, may flights of devils wing you to your rest."
2524,interview with the vampire: the vampire chronicles,"Though the fire seemed to spread through the quarter, I stood on that deck, fearful he would come out again from the very river, like some monster, to destroy us both. And all the while, I thought, 'Lestat, you deserve your vengeance. You gave me the dark gift, and I delivered you into the hands of death for the second time.'"
2525,into the wild,"I'm going to paraphrase Thoreau here... rather than love, than money, than faith, than fame, than fairness... give me truth."
2526,into the wild,I'm supertramp.  and you're super apple!
2527,intolerable cruelty,I'm gonna nail your ass!
2528,intolerable cruelty,Told him it was no go...
2529,intolerable cruelty,"Hmm... Hmm... Yes, your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of a pool man would appear to be suspicious. But, Madam, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest to you the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion had slapped you, beat you."
2530,intolerable cruelty,"Well, I think it stinks. They left you with nothing. Makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney... Whatshisname."
2531,intolerable cruelty,"Let me rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?"
2532,inventing the abbotts,"You look like a clown. He looks like a clown, mom, and he doesn't even know it."
2533,inventing the abbotts,"Hey, Jacey... Remember that time I got my dick caught in my zipper?"
2534,inventing the abbotts,You do realize you may be the only person at this party with artificial sideburns?
2535,inventing the abbotts,"Look, I'm not rich. My father is. And I don't pick my father. And if I had a choice between having tons of money or having another father, I'd be absolutely deligthed to be poor. But unfortunately, life is just not a cafeteria."
2536,inventing the abbotts,Backyard nudity is hypocritical. It's insincere. People should do and say exactly what they feel and think and not try to hide things.
2537,inventing the abbotts,You didn't know your mother at all if you think someone like me would ever stood a chance with someone like her.
2538,it happened one night,"You know, I had you pegged right from the jump. Just a spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you get anything is to buy it, isn't it? You're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word humility? No, you wouldn't. I guess it would never occur to you to just say, 'Please mister, I'm in trouble, will you help me?' No, that would bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Well, let me tell you something, maybe it will take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problem. You, King Westley, your father. You're all a lot of hooey to me!"
2539,it happened one night,"That's the way things go: you think you got a great yarn, and something comes along and messes up the finish - and there you are."
2540,it's a wonderful life,"Ohh, there must be some easier way for me to get my wings."
2541,it's a wonderful life,A toast to my big brother George: The richest man in town.
2542,it's a wonderful life,"I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow, and the next day, and the next year, and the year after that."
2543,it's a wonderful life,"Where's that money, you silly stupid old fool? Where's that money? Do you realize what this means? It means bankruptcy and scandal and prison! That's what it means! One of us is going to jail... well, it's not gonna be me!"
2544,it's a wonderful life,"Look at you. You used to be so cocky. You were going to go out and conquer the world. You once called me ""a warped, frustrated, old man!"" What are you but a warped, frustrated young man? A miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help. No securities, no stocks, no bonds. Nothin' but a miserable little $500 equity in a life insurance policy.  You're worth more dead than alive!"
2545,it's a wonderful life,"Just a minute... just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no businessman. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anyone else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was... why, in the 25 years since he and his brother, Uncle Billy, started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry away to college, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter, and what's wrong with that? Why... here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You... you said... what'd you say a minute ago? They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait? Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken down that they... Do you know how long it takes a working man to save $5,000? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about... they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him. But to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well in my book, my father died a much richer man than you'll ever be!"
2546,it's a wonderful life,You call this a happy family? Why do we have to have all these kids?
2547,it's a wonderful life,"Strange, isn't it? Each man's life touches so many other lives. When he isn't around he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?"
2548,it's a wonderful life,"I owe everything to George Bailey. Help him, dear Father."
2549,it's a wonderful life,Boys and girls and music. Why do they need gin?
2550,it's a wonderful life,"Dear Father in heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me  show me the way... show me the way."
2551,it's a wonderful life,"What's the matter, Othello - jealous? Did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor? And did you know that *button* behind you causes this floor to open up? And did you further know that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack?  I've got the key!"
2552,it's a wonderful life,"Watch this guy, Bert, he's bats!"
2553,it's a wonderful life,"You've been given a great gift, George: A chance to see what the world would be like without you."
2554,it's a wonderful life,"Well, you look about the kind of angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?"
2555,it's a wonderful life,I wish I had a million dollars... Hot dog!
2556,it's a wonderful life,"I been savin' this money for a divorce, if ever I got a husband."
2557,it's a wonderful life,"After all, Potter, some people like George HAD to stay at home. Not every heel was in Germany and Japan."
2558,it's a wonderful life,Get me. I'm givin' out wings!
2559,it's a wonderful life,I feel like a bootlegger's wife!
2560,it's a wonderful life,Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail!
2561,it's complicated,Is it really necessary for you to always say no before you say yes?
2562,jackie brown,"Ordell, this isn't a bar. You don't have a tab."
2563,jackie brown,"Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit."

If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?"
2568,jackie brown,"Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waiting on people almost 20 years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothing to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that shit is scarier than Ordell."
2569,jackie brown,Uh uh uh... I didn't hear you wash your hands.
2570,jackie brown,"Shit, Jackie. You come in this place on Saturday night I bet you need nigger repellant to keep motherfuckers off your ass."
2571,jackie brown,Is white guilt supposed to make me forget that I run a business?
2572,jackie brown,"You know, a good cop will never let you know he knows you're full of shit."
2573,jackie brown,Half a million dollars will always be missed.

2577,jackie brown,You can't trust Melanie but you can trust Melanie to be Melanie.
2578,jackie brown,"Jesus, but if you two are not the biggest pair of fuck-ups I've ever met in my entire life. How did you ever rob a bank? When you robbed banks, did you forget where your car was then too? No wonder you went to jail."
2579,jacob's ladder,Mr. Singer. What an appropriate name for a man who can't shut up.

2673,jfk,"Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President? Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back? Could the Mob get the FBI the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation? Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up? could the Mob wreck the autopsy? Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close. The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude. Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules. This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings."

Now your latest theory seems to be that the CIA, the FBI, and the Pentagon, and the White House, all combined in some elaborate conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. Let me ask you, is there anyone besides Lee Harvey Oswald who you think *didn't* conspire to kill the president?"

As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then they may talk. So, the organization has already had the time it needs to render any information useless.

Instead she spoke of a prophecy. Of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of mankind would be decided. One night, I finally got the courage to ask my mother why God had changed, why He was so mad at His children. ""I don't know,"" she said, tucking the covers around me, ""I guess He just got tired of all the bullshit."""

2921,lord of the rings the two towers,Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I did not pass through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
2922,lord of the rings the two towers,"So this is the answer to all the riddles: here in the wild I have you, two halflings and a host of men at my call, and the Ring of Power within my grasp."
2923,lord of the rings the two towers,His staff. I told you to take the Wizard's staff.
2924,lord of the rings the two towers,"Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys."
2925,lord of the rings the two towers,"I'm wasted on cross-country! We Dwarves are natural sprinters, very dangerous over short distances."
2926,lord of the rings the two towers,Hasufel! Arod! May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
2927,lord of the rings the two towers,"A red sun rises, blood has been spilled this night."
2928,lord of the rings the two towers,"Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end, as to be worthy of remembrance."
2929,lord of the rings the two towers,Bring your pretty face to my axe.
2930,lord of war,I don't care if it's legal! It's wrong.
2931,lord of war,"You underestimate yourself Aleksei. You're the best. You're the shit Aleksei, you're the shit! You're the shit! You're the shit!"
2932,lord of war,"You can fight a lot of enemies and survive, but not your biology."
2933,lord of war,The first and most important rule of gun-running is: Never get shot with your own merchandise.
2934,lord of war,"Every faction in Africa calls themselves by these noble names - Liberation this, Patriotic that, Democratic Republic of something-or-other... I guess they can't own up to what they usually are: the Federation of Worse Oppressors Than the Last Bunch of Oppressors. Often, the most barbaric atrocities occur when both combatants proclaim themselves Freedom Fighters."
2935,lord of war,"Some of the most successful relationships are based on lies and deceit. Since that's where they usually end up anyway, it's a logical place to start."
2936,lord of war,"Of all the weapons in the vast soviet arsenal, nothing was more profitable than Avtomat Kalashnikova model of 1947. More commonly known as the AK-47, or Kalashnikov. It's the world's most popular assault rifle. A weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple 9 pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood. It doesn't break, jam, or overheat. It'll shoot whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do. The Soviets put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag. Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people's greatest export. After that comes vodka, caviar, and suicidal novelists. One thing is for sure, no one was lining up to buy their cars."
2937,lord of war,"The problem with gun runners going to war, is that there is no shortage of ammunition."
2938,lord of war,There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is: How do we arm the other 11?
2939,lord of war,In the most AIDS-infested region of the globe - where 1 in 4 is infected - Andy's idea of a joke was to put a young Iman and a young Naomi in my bed - and no condom within a hundred miles.
2940,lord of war,"Sir! Sir, may I interest you in the shoulder fired S-37 surface-to-air missle? It's the old Chinese model. Not so effective against modern military aircraft but deadly if used against a commerical airliner."
2941,lord of war,"Thank God there are still legal ways to exploit developing countries. The only problem with an honest buck is they're so hard to make - the margins are too low, too many people are doin' it."
2942,lord of war,"I would tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there."
2943,lord of war,The second rule of gun-running is always ensure you have a foolproof way of getting paid.

Racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane, and yet always there to greet us... with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that, somehow, you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms."

2993,magnolia,"...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't... and I will listen... I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want... and you know, you know... I won't judge you... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't... I can... listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you..."

Because I want to do well - in this life and in this world, I want to do well. And I want to help people. And I might get twenty bad calls a day. But one time I can help someone and make a save - correct a wrong or right a situation - then I'm a happy cop. And as we move through this life we should try and do good. Do good... And if we can do that, and not hurt anyone else, well... then..."

""Well... all we were asking was the common element, Donnie... but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge... haha, kids! Heads so full of useless knowledge. Thank you. Thank you."" And the book says: ""We may be through with the past... but the past is not through with us!""  And... no, it is not dangerous to confuse children with angels!"
3005,magnolia,"A lot of people think this is just a job that you go to. Take a lunch hour... job's over. Something like that. But it's a 24-hour deal. No two ways about it. And what most people don't see... is just how hard it is to do the right thing. People think if I make a judgment call... that's a judgment on them, but that is not what I do. And that's not what should be done. I have to take everything... and play it as it lays. Sometimes people need a little help. Sometimes people need to be forgiven. And sometimes they need to go to jail. And that is a very tricky thing on my part... making that call. I mean, the law is the law. And heck if I'm gonna break it. You can forgive someone. Well, that's the tough part. What can we forgive? Tough part of the job. Tough part of walking down the street."

3098,meet joe black,"Love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. I say, fall head over heels. Find someone you can love like crazy and who will love you the same way back. How do you find him? Well, you forget your head, and you listen to your heart. And I'm not hearing any heart. Cause the truth is, honey, there's no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love, well, you haven't lived a life at all. But you have to try, cause if you haven't tried, you haven't lived."

3105,meet john doe,"If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost someplace!"
3106,meet john doe,"I don't read no papers, and I don't listen to radios either. I know the world's been shaved by a drunken barber, and I don't have to read it."
3107,meet john doe,I've seen guys like you before. Guys that never had to worry. Then they get a hold of some dough and go goofy.

3114,memento,You're not a killer.  That's why you're so good at it.
3115,memento,"I have to believe in a world outside my own mind. I have to believe that my actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there. Do I believe the world's still there? Is it still out there?... Yeah. We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are. I'm no different."

3120,men in black,"You idiots! You don't get it - I've won! It's over! You're milksuckers! You don't matter! In fact, in just a few seconds you won't even BE matter!"
3121,men in black,This caused the 1977 New York blackout. A practical joke by the great attractor. He thought it was funny as hell.

3155,milk,"I ask this... If there should be an assassination, I would hope that five, ten, one hundred, a thousand would rise. I would like to see every gay lawyer, every gay architect come out - - If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door... And that's all. I ask for the movement to continue. Because it's not about personal gain, not about ego, not about power... it's about the ""us's"" out there. Not only gays, but the Blacks, the Asians, the disabled, the seniors, the us's. Without hope, the us's give up - I know you cannot live on hope alone, but without it, life is not worth living.

We are here to ruin ourselves and to break our hearts and love the wrong people and *die*. The storybooks are *bullshit*. Now I want you to come upstairs with me and *get* in my bed!"

So tomorrow night when we meet, if you'd be so kind as to bring all the pictures and the memory card from your camera. That way we could like each other simply for who we are. If you don't show up, I will presume that you've gone to the police, and I will kill you. Even if I go to jail because of you, Mr. Smith, someone will find you, wherever you are, and they will kill you."

No, the Irish must be told, very firmly, to stay exactly where they are. It is the thin edge of the wedge, Mr Disraeli. Next, you will be telling me that the Crown no longer governs this nation."
3241,mrs brown,"Yesterday, Gladstone talked for three hours on the Irish Church Bill... I am as guilty as the rest of underestimating his reforming zeal. Tory days may be numbered, but I fancy there yet remains one last hope of deliverance. Wheresoever the blame lies, we must now close ranks and defend Mrs Brown's England. As for my interminable journey to the land of Calvin, oatcakes and sulphur...  no Prime Minister made greater sacrifice than attempting to run the country six hundred miles north of civilization."

So, the Go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe."

3483,pi,"Hold on. You have to slow down. You're losing it. You have to take a breath. Listen to yourself. You're connecting a computer bug I had with a computer bug you might have had and some religious hogwash. You want to find the number 216 in the world, you will be able to find it everywhere. 216 steps from a mere street corner to your front door. 216 seconds you spend riding on the elevator. When your mind becomes obsessed with anything, you will filter everything else out and find that thing everywhere."

3488,pi,"Have you met Archimedes? The one with the black spots, you see? You remember Archimedes of Syracuse, eh? The king asks Archimedes to determine if a present he's received is actually solid gold. Unsolved problem at the time. It tortures the great Greek mathematician for weeks - insomnia haunts him and he twists and turns in his bed for nights on end. Finally, his equally exhausted wife - she's forced to share a bed with this genius - convinces him to take a bath to relax. While he's entering the tub, Archimedes notices the bath water rise. Displacement, a way to determine volume, and that's a way to determine density - weight over volume. And thus, Archimedes solves the problem. He screams ""Eureka"" and he is so overwhelmed he runs dripping naked through the streets to the king's palace to report his discovery."

3549,platoon,"I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy; we fought ourselves. The enemy was in us. The war is over for me now, but it will always be there, the rest of my days. As I'm sure Elias will be, fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called ""possession of my soul."" There are times since, I've felt like a child, born of those two fathers. But be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again. To teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and a meaning to this life."
3550,platoon,"The village, which had stood for maybe a thousand years, didn't know we were coming that day. If they had, they would've run. Barnes was the eye of our rage. And through him, our captain Ahab, we would set things right again. That day we loved him."

3596,psycho,I'll lick the stamps.
3597,psycho,"Like I said... the mother... Now to understand it the way I understood it, hearing it from the mother... that is, from the mother half of Norman's mind... you have to go back ten years, to the time when Norman murdered his mother and her lover. Now he was already dangerously disturbed, had been ever since his father died. His mother was a clinging, demanding woman, and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world. Then she met a man... and it seemed to Norman that she 'threw him over' for this man. Now that pushed him over the line and he killed 'em both. Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all... most unbearable to the son who commits it. So he had to erase the crime, at least in his own mind. He stole her corpse. A weighted coffin was buried. He hid the body in the fruit cellar. Even treated it to keep it as well as it would keep. And that still wasn't enough. She was there! But she was a corpse. So he began to think and speak for her, give her half his time, so to speak. At times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations. At other times, the mother half took over completely. Now he was never all Norman, but he was often only mother. And because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed that she was jealous of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman, the mother side of him would go wild.  When he met your sister, he was touched by her... aroused by her. He wanted her. That set off the 'jealous mother' and 'mother killed the girl'! Now after the murder, Norman returned as if from a deep sleep. And like a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his mother had committed!"

3769,reservoir dogs,"The choice between doing ten years and taking out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman."
3770,reservoir dogs,"I'm very sorry the government taxes their tips, that's fucked up. That ain't my fault. It would seem to me that waitresses are one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis. Look, if you ask me to sign something that says the government shouldn't do that, I'll sign it, put it to a vote, I'll vote for it, but what I won't do is play ball. And as for this non-college bullshit I got two words for that: learn to fuckin' type, 'cause if you're expecting me to help out with the rent you're in for a big fuckin' surprise."

That second one just plum near cut his head in two... It's a lil' ol' white house on the corner of Vine Street and some other street. There's a pick-up truck out front that says ""Doyle Hargraves Construction"" on it. Doyle said besides sending the police, you might wanna send an ambulance or a ""hearst"".

She was a Georgia peach. In fact, she was the picture I had in my mind of the perfect woman so I took it upon myself to take her away from John Leggit Hunter who did not deserve her. Oh, I don't know if I mentioned this but he was a Frenchman who claimed to be an Englishman. It took a lot of strong nylon cord to get her away from him because she was a fighter as well as being a Georgia peach."

4271,speed racer,"Racing's in our blood. Like for Pops, it isn't just a sport. It's way more important than that. It's like a religion. And in our house, the major sponsors are kind of like the devil.

4276,speed racer,"I know he blew up at Fuji, but this kid is flat out magic!"
4277,speed racer,"Speed Racer, slow down!"
4278,speed racer,"Interesting that you and your father were so moved by the '43 Prix. One of the great finishes in the history of racing, right? Everyone remembers Burns and Stickleton slugging it out. But who remembers Carl Potts? Driving this rebuilt Wittigan for lodyne Industries, Potts spun out in the second lap and went down as a DNF, a forgettable and pathetic finish, so bad that afterwards, lodyne stock dropped six points. But as Ben Burns sat guzzling cold, fresh milk in Victory Lane, a thousand cameras taking his picture, Sirrus Aeronautics saw almost a 12-point gain, which immediately blocked Penninsula Power Cell from being able to afford the price of a complete takeover. This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of lodyne, Inc., in the exact position he wanted to be in. By first buying controlling interest in his own company at a devalued price, he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that immediately sent lodyne into the gains record book, the only record book that matters. Look out that window. There isn't a single plane or helicopter or K-Harrier that isn't powered by lodyne fuel cells. That's what racing is about. It has nothing to do with cars or drivers. All that matters is power, and the unassailable might of money!"

4401,star trek: the wrath of khan,"Damn it Jim, what the hell is the matter with you? Other people have birthdays, why are we treating yours like a funeral?"
4402,star trek: the wrath of khan,"He is intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two-dimensional thinking."
4403,star trek: the wrath of khan,"We are gathered here today to pay final respects to our honored dead. But it should be noted that this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world; a world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish. He did not feel this sacrifice a vain or empty one, and we will not debate his profound wisdom at these proceedings. Of my friend, I can only say this: of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most... human."
4404,star trek: the wrath of khan,I'll give him this: he's consistent!
4405,star trek: the wrath of khan,"The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree, so don't give me too many bumps."
4406,star trek: the wrath of khan,You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
4407,star trek: the wrath of khan,"Scotty, I need warp speed in three minutes or we're all dead!"
4408,star trek: the wrath of khan,Who's been holding up the damn elevator?
4409,star trek: the wrath of khan,"Space: the final frontier. These are the continuing voyages of the starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life forms and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before."
4410,star wars,"For over a thousand generations, the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic... before the dark times... before the empire."
4411,star wars,"And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. And this is my counterpart R2D2."
4412,star wars,The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.
4413,star wars,"In my experience, there's no such thing as luck."
4414,star wars,"Get in there, you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell!"
4415,star wars,Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
4416,star wars,I have a very bad feeling about this.
4417,star wars,"Alright, come on. And the red one. Come on. Well, come on Red, let's go."
4418,star wars,"Someone has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, fly boy."
4419,star wars,Now don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is far beyond my capacity!
4420,star wars,"That malfunctioning little twirp, this is all his fault."
4421,star wars,You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought.
4422,star wars,"Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease."
4423,star wars,"Hello there.  Come here, my little friend. Don't be afraid.  Oh don't worry, he'll be alright."
4424,star wars,"This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi, it will soon see the end of the Rebellion."
4425,star wars,"Great shot, kid, that was one in a million!"
4426,star wars,"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.  Don't everyone thank me at once."
4427,star wars,"And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base..."
4428,star wars,Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault!
4429,star wars,"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid."
4430,star wars,He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here; he'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.  The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
4431,star wars,Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me!
4432,star wars,"The Force will be with you, always."
4433,star wars,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope."
4434,star wars,"If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from."
4435,star wars,"I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened."
4436,star wars,Wonderful girl. Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.
4437,star wars,Did you hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness.
4438,star wars,"One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner."
4439,star wars,I knew there was more to you than money!
4440,star wars,"Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else."
4441,star wars,"Just you reconsider playing that message for him!  No, I don't think he likes you at all.  No, I don't like you either."
4442,star wars,The Force is strong with this one.
4443,star wars,Mos Eisley spaceport: You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.
4444,star wars,There'll be no escape for the princess this time.
4445,star wars,"I don't know who you are or where you came from, but from now on you'll do as I tell you, okay?"
4446,star wars,"Sure hope the old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!"
4447,star wars,That's no moon. It's a space station.
4448,star wars,Where are you taking this... thing?
4449,star wars,Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them.
4450,star wars,I sense something; a presence I've not felt since...
4451,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,Boba Fett? Boba Fett? Where?
4452,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,"I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears that you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor."
4453,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,Split up and head back to the surface. And see if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.
4454,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,I have a really bad feeling about this.
4455,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,"Command station, this is ST321, code clearance blue. We're starting our approach; deactivate the security shield."
4456,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,I see you have constructed a new light saber. Your skills are complete. Indeed you are powerful as the Emperor has foreseen.
4457,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Luke... Luke... do not... do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor or suffer your father's fate you will. Luke, when gone am I... the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke. There is... another... Sky... walker."
4458,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational!
4459,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,"General, count me in."
4460,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,What could possibly have come over Master Luke? Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work.
4461,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,I have decided that we shall stay here.
4462,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,"Don't worry, my friend's down there. He'll have that shield down in time.  Or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time."
4463,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,"If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short circuit."
4464,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,"It's over, Commander. The rebels have been routed and they're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit."
4465,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.
4466,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,"The alliance... will die. As will your friends. Good, I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon. Strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey towards the dark side will be complete!"
4467,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,"You can see here, the Death Star orbiting the forest moon of Endor. Although, the weapon systems on this Death Star or not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield which is generated from the nearby forest moon of Endor.  The sheild must be deactivated, if any attack is to be attempted.  Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while our fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor."
4468,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,Obi-Wan has taught you well.
4469,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,"Wait, I know that laugh..."
4470,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,"The Emperor's made a critical error, and the time for our attack has come."
4471,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,"And now, young Skywalker... you will die."
4472,star wars: episode vi - return of the jedi,Exciting is hardly the word I would choose.
4473,starman,I gave you a baby tonight.
4474,starship troopers,I expect the best and I give the best. Here's the beer. Here's the entertainment. Now have fun. That's an order!
4475,starship troopers,"I need a corporal. You're it, until you're dead or I find someone better."
4476,starship troopers,"This is for all you new people: I only have one rule. Everyone fights. No one quits. You don't do your job, I'll shoot you myself. You get me?"
4477,starship troopers,Join the Mobile Infantry and save the Galaxy. Service guarantees citizenship. Would you like to know more?
4478,starship troopers,"Anytime you think I'm being too rough, anytime you think I'm being too tough, anytime you miss-your-mommy, QUIT! You sign your 1248, you get your gear, and you take a stroll down washout lane. Do you get me?"
4479,starship troopers,The only good bug is a dead bug.
4480,starship troopers,Ain't it great how they want to be your friend right after they rip your guts out?
4481,starship troopers,"You're some sort of big, fat, smart-bug, aren't you?"
4482,starship troopers,"I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill 'em all!"
4483,state and main,This is what my people died for... the right to make a movie in this town.
4484,state and main,"No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was the criminal. Yup, you came to the right place. Jesse James was the brother.... Of the novelist. That's right, Susie. See you tomorrow, Susie."
4485,state and main,"Everybody makes their own fun. If you don't make it yourself, it isn't fun. It's entertainment."
4486,state and main,You know what you got there? You got a fishhook in your finger. I'm right proud of you.
4487,state and main,It's not a lie. It's a gift for fiction.
4488,state and main,"Who designed these costumes? It looks like Edith Head puked, and that puke designed these costumes."
4489,state and main,It's the truth that you should never trust anybody who wears a bow tie. Cravat's supposed to point down to accentuate the genitals. Why'd you wanna trust somebody whose tie points out to accentuate his ears?
4490,state and main,"If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape."
4491,state and main,"Only second chance I know, is the chance to make the same mistake twice."
4492,state and main,Everybody needs a hobby.
4493,stepmom,"What is it that your worried about, looking bad at the P.T.A?"
4494,stepmom,I'm sorry you're sick.
4495,stepmom,"Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it isn't there."
4496,stir of echoes,Look what I'm not cleaning up.
4497,stir of echoes,"Don't be afraid of it, Daddy."
4498,stir of echoes,Why don't you just lick 'em when they walk by?
4499,storytelling,"I don't know about what happened... because once you start writing, it ALL becomes fiction."
4500,storytelling,I'm not an idiot man. I watch TV.
4501,strange days,"I can use this, it's not bad, but, listen honey, you've got to move your eyes slower next time, much much slower. Like... like you're making love with your eyes, ok?"
4502,strange days,This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe... it's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
4503,strange days,"This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?"
4504,strange days,"The issue isn't whether you're paranoid, but whether you're paranoid enough."
4505,strange days,"Well, I've lost my appetite.  For about a year."
4506,strange days,Paranoia is just reality on a finer scale.
4507,strange days,"Look... everyone needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometimes, it's what we are."
4508,strange days,The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she is giving head.
4509,strange days,"You're gonna be in my next song. It's called ""RoboSteckler."" It's about a cop who met his worst nightmare: a nigga with enough political juice to squash your ass like a stinkbug! You gonna be famous, fucker!"
4510,strange days,"When I met Faith, she was just another runaway, giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crack. Just another lost soul. But she had this voice... it was scary, like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to Heaven in one voice. I helped her. And I promised her I'd always just be there, to protect her. See, it's not about what's in her head, it's what's in mine. I can't let go of the promise. It's like it's all I have left."
4511,strange days,"You know one of the ways movies are still better than playback? The music comes up, there's credits, and you always know when it's over.  IT'S OVER!"
4512,strange days,Oooh... a little B&E action.
4513,strange days,Memories are meant to fade. They're designed that way for a reason.
4514,strange days,You put that thing on the 11 o'clock news and by midnight you'll have the biggest riot in history. They'll see the smoke from Canada.
4515,strange days,"Jesus Lenny, you scared the fuck out of me!"
4516,strangers on a train,"Oh, Daddy doesn't mind a little scandal. He's a senator."
4517,strangers on a train,"Everyone has somebody that they want to put out of the way. Oh now surely, Madam, you're not going to tell me that there hasn't been a time that you didn't want to dispose of someone. Your husband, for instance?"
4518,strangers on a train,"I may be old-fashioned, but I thought murder was against the law."
4519,strangers on a train,"Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot you, Mr. Haines. It might disturb Mother."
4520,strangers on a train,I admire people who do things.
4521,strangers on a train,Doesn't that bloodhound ever relax? He sticks so close he's beginning to grow on me - like a fungus.
4522,strangers on a train,I still think it would be wonderful to have a man love you so much he'd kill for you.
4523,suburbia,"Anything is possible. It is night on planet earth and I'm alive. And someday I'll be dead. Someday I'll just be bones in a box, but right now, I'm not. And anything is possible. And that's why I can go to New York with Sooze because each moment can just be what it is. There's no failure, there's no mistake. I just, I just go there and live there and what happens, happens. And so, right now I'm getting naked and I'm not afraid. You know? I don't, I don't need money, man. I don't, I don't even need, I don't even need a future. I, I could knock out all of my teeth with a hammer. So what? You know, I could poke my eyes out. I'd still be alive, you know? At least I'd know that I was doing something real for two or three seconds, you know? It's all about feat and I'm not afraid anymore, man. Fuck it! Fuck fear!"
4524,suburbia,"At least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up, beyond belief, and I have nothing original to say about it..."
4525,suburbia,"I expanded my horizons, you know, served my country, saw the world, you know. I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road, me and Jack Kerouac."

4529,sugar & spice,Jack Bartlett. Jack Bartlett! Jack Bartlett. Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
4530,sugar & spice,I feel totally abandon in a place that values physical prowess over mental acuity. I can't wait until all of that changes in the real world.
4531,sugar & spice,"Then, there's Hannah Wald. She's this uber-Christian, doesn't really say much. In fact, if she wasn't kinda pretty, you'd say ''Hey, who's the 'tard?''"
4532,sugar & spice,"If the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that, in America, you can cut somebody's head off and still be innocent as long as you have enough money. Well Kansas your mom only shoot a guy."
4533,sugar & spice,"Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant. You had it, threw it out, and now you're gonna go dance all night?"
4534,sugar & spice,"Yeah? Well, how would you like me to introduce my foot into your ass!"

4537,sunset blvd,"There once was a time in this business when I had the eyes of the whole world! But that wasn't good enough for them, oh no! They had to have the ears of the whole world too. So they opened their big mouths and out came talk. Talk! TALK!"
4538,sunset blvd,"She was the greatest of them all. You wouldn't know, you're too young. In one week she received 17,000 fan letters. Men bribed her hairdresser to get a lock of her hair. There was a maharajah who came all the way from India to beg one of her silk stockings. Later he strangled himself with it!"
4539,sunset blvd,"Norma, you're a woman of 50, now grow up. There's nothing tragic about being 50, not unless you try to be 25."
4540,sunset blvd,"As long as the lady is paying for it, why not take the Vicuna?"

4555,superman,"You were great in your day, Superman. But it just stands to reason, when it came time to cash in your chips, this old... diseased... maniac would be your banker."
4556,superman,I wonder what they're wearing in Addis Ababa?
4557,superman,All those things I can do. All those powers. And I couldn't even save him.
4558,superman,Some people can read War and Peace and come away thinking it's a simple adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the universe.
4559,superman,"There's a strong streak of good in you, Superman. But then nobody's perfect... almost nobody."
4560,superman,"The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El. It has therefore now become your decision. You alone will condemn us if you wish, and you alone will be held responsible by me."
4561,superman,"Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack."
4562,superman,"You will travel far, my little Kal-El. But we will never leave you... even in the face of our death. The richness of our lives shall be yours. All that I have, all that I've learned, everything I feel... all this, and more, I... I bequeath you, my son. You will carry me inside you, all the days of your life. You will make my strength your own, and see my life through your eyes, as your life will be seen through mine. The son becomes the father, and the father the son. This is all I... all I can send you, Kal-El."
4563,superman,"This is Lex Luthor. Only one thing alive with less than four legs can hear this frequency, Superman, and that's you."

4567,superman ii,"Superman! Thank God!  I mean, get him!"
4568,superman ii,"... Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. I mean, it's all WHITE! Why doesn't this Superman guy put up some nice posters here... Maybe some bullfighting stuff, or a pool table...!"

4579,superman iv: the quest for peace,"I'd want to tell him that I cherished the time we spent together, and I never expected anything from him.

And... no matter what happens on this world, I know he tried his best to help us."

4582,suspect zero,"I know what you're thinking. ""Pain is coming. Will I take it like a man?"" Well, let me put you at ease. You won't. None of them do. Men, women, children, they all weep, they all beg, they piss themselves, they attempt negotiation. You wouldn't believe how many men I've seen lying right where you're lying right now, grown men with wives amd children at home, offering all kinds of sexual gratification for a five-minute reprieve.

4610,swingers,So let me get this straight. The party started at eight. Why are we going to a bar at ten?
4611,swingers,"You take yourself out of the game, you start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream and of course it's going to end up on the friendship tip."
4612,swingers,They went with someone who had more theme-park experience.
4613,swingers,"Trent, the beautiful babies don't work the midnight to six shift on a Wednesday. This is like the skank shift."

4620,swordfish,Too Bad ! You are gonna die !
4621,swordfish,Surprised that a girl with an IQ over seventy can give you a hard on?
4622,swordfish,I have been told that the best crackers in the world can do this under 60 minutes but unfortunately I need someone who can do this under 60 seconds.
4623,"synecdoche, new york",I don't think you should tell her she doesn't have blood...
4624,"synecdoche, new york",I know how to do it now. There are nearly thirteen million people in the world. None of those people is an extra. They're all the leads of their own stories. They have to be given their due.
4625,"synecdoche, new york","Hazel, you've been a part of me forever. Don't you know that? I breathe your name in every exhalation."
4626,"synecdoche, new york",I know how to do the play now. It will all take place over the course of one day. And that day will be the day before you died. That day was the happiest day of my life. Then I'll be able to live it forever. See you soon.
4627,"synecdoche, new york","Try to keep in mind that a young person playing Willie Loman thinks he's only pretending to be at the end of a life full of despair. But the tragedy is that we know that you, the young actor will end up in this very place of desolation."
4628,"synecdoche, new york",Glad to be weirdly close.
4629,"synecdoche, new york","Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I've felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I've been pretending I'm OK, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own. Well, fuck everybody. Amen."
4630,"synecdoche, new york",I don't know what I'm doing.
4631,"synecdoche, new york",I wish we had this when we were young. And all those years in between.
4632,"synecdoche, new york","My father died. They said his body was riddled with cancer and that he didn't know, he went in because his finger hurt. They said he suffered horribly, and that he called out for me before he died. They said that he said he regretted his life. They said he said a lot of things, too many to recount, and they said it was the longest and the saddest deathbed speech any of them had ever heard."
4633,tall in the saddle,I never feel sorry for anything that happens to a woman.
4634,tall in the saddle,Has somebody come to town!
4635,taxi driver,Have you ever seen what a .44 Magnum will do to a woman's pussy? Now that you should see. What a .44 Magnum will do to a woman's pussy that you should see?
4636,taxi driver,"Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is a man who stood up."
4637,taxi driver,"I think I know what you mean, Travis."
4638,taxi driver,Now I see this clearly. My whole life is pointed in one direction. There never has been a choice for me.
4639,taxi driver,"I first saw her at Palantine Campaign headquarters at 63rd and Broadway. She was wearing a white dress. She appeared like an angel. Out of this filthy mess, she is alone. They... cannot... touch... her."
4640,taxi driver,"I realize now how much she's just like the others, cold and distant, and many people are like that, women for sure, they're like a union."
4641,taxi driver,"Each night when I return the cab to the garage, I have to clean the cum off the back seat. Some nights, I clean off the blood."
4642,taxi driver,"The days go on and on... they don't end. All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go. I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention, I believe that one should become a person like other people."
4643,taxi driver,How's everything in the pimp business?
4644,taxi driver,Twelve hours of work and I still can't sleep. Damn. Days go on and on. They don't end.
4645,taxi driver,The idea had been growing in my brain for some time: TRUE force. All the king's men cannot put it back together again.

4652,terminator,Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do. Don't do that again.
4653,terminator,I can hear it now. He's going to be called the god-damned phonebook killer.
4654,terminator,"Hey, man, you've got a serious attitude problem."
4655,terminator,This is 1-L19. Westbound on Olympic approaching Overland.
4656,terminator,"Look at it this way: in a hundred years, who's gonna care?"
4657,terminator,"The hardest thing is deciding what I should tell you and what not to. Well, anyway, I've got a while yet before you're old enough to understand the tapes. They're more for me at this point... to help get it all straight. Should I tell you about your father? That's a tough one. Will it change your decision to send him here... knowing? But if you don't send Kyle, you could never be. God, you can go crazy thinking about all this... I suppose I'll tell you... I owe him that. And maybe it'll be enough if you know that in the few hours we had together we loved a lifetime's worth."
4658,terminator,"Hey, buddy, did you just see a real bright light?"
4659,terminator,"Listen, and understand. That terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead."
4660,terminator,There's a storm coming.
4661,terminator 2: judgment day,I swear I will not kill anyone.

4663,terminator 2: judgment day,"So, what's your story?"
4664,terminator 2: judgment day,Come with me if you want to live!
4665,terminator 2: judgment day,What's wrong with your eyes?
4666,terminator 2: judgment day,I know now why you cry. But it's something I can never do.
4667,terminator 2: judgment day,The whole thing goes: The future's not set. There's no fate but what we make for ourselves.
4668,terminator 2: judgment day,"Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly so clear. The terminator, would never stop. It would never leave him, and it would never hurt him, never shout at him, or get drunk and hit him, or say it was too busy to spend time with him. It would always be there. And it would die, to protect him. Of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years, this thing, this machine, was the only one who measured up. In an insane world, it was the sanest choice."
4669,terminator 2: judgment day,"Hasta la vista, baby."
4670,terminator 2: judgment day,"We got Skynet by the balls now, don't we?"
4671,terminator 2: judgment day,"Now don't take this the wrong way, but you're a terminator, right?"
4672,terminator 2: judgment day,"You're the one livin' in a fuckin' dream, Silberman! 'Cause I know when it happens! It happens!"
4673,terminator 2: judgment day,"The unknown future rolls toward us. I face it, for the first time, with a sense of hope. Because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too."
4674,terminator 2: judgment day,"Your foster parents are kinda dicks, huh?"

4724,the american president,"Seven trillion dollar communications system at my disposal, and I can't find out if the Packers won."
4725,the american president,"Let me see if I got this. The third story on the news tonight was that someone I didn't know thirteen years ago when I wasn't president participated in a demonstration where no laws were being broken in protest of something that so many people were against, it doesn't exist anymore. Just out of curiosity, what was the fourth story?"
4726,the american president,"If anyone needs me, I'll be in the Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen."
4727,the american president,"Yeah, hi, good morning... how do I get an outside line?  Well, that was easy."
4728,the american president,There's never an egg timer around when you need one.
4729,the american president,"Sydney, Congress doesn't take this long."
4730,the american president,"We had a nice couple of minutes together. She threatened me, I patronized her. Didn't have anything to eat, but I thought there was a connection."
4731,the american president,"America isn't easy. America is advanced citizenship. You've got to want it bad, because it's gonna put up a fight. It's gonna say, ""You want free speech? Let's see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil who is standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours. You want to claim this land as the 'land of the free'? Then the symbol of your country cannot just be a flag. The symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest. Now show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then you can stand up and sing about the 'land of the free.'"""

4735,the apartment,"Premium-wise and billing-wise, we are eighteen percent ahead of last year, October-wise."
4736,the apartment,"All right, Miss Kubelik, get up.  It's past checking-out time. The management would greatly appreciate it if you would get the hell out of here!  I used to like you. I used to like you a lot. But it's all over between us. So beat it!  Oh, you, tee, out!  C'mon, wake up!  Oh, my God...!"
4737,the apartment,Just because I wear a uniform doesn't make me a girl scout.
4738,the apartment,"Ya know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe; I mean, shipwrecked among 8 million people. And then one day I saw a footprint in the sand, and there you were."
4739,the apartment,"Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character, and as far as I'm concerned you're tops. I mean, decency-wise and otherwise-wise."

4750,the beach,"Richard, this is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Americans always say to French girls so they can sleep with them."
4751,the beach,"When you develop an infatuation for someone you always find a reason to believe that this is exactly the person for you. It doesn't need to be a good reason. Taking photographs of the night sky, for example. Now, in the long run, that's just the kind of dumb, irritating habit that would cause you to split up. But in the haze of infatuation, it's just what you've been searching for all these years."
4752,the beach,"Now get some sleep, I may wish to have sex again before we eat breakfast."
4753,the beach,"You hope, and you dream. But you never believe that something's gonna happen for you. Not like it does in the movies. And when it actually does, you want it to feel different, more visceral, more real. I was waiting for it to hit me, but it just wouldn't happen. The police were pissed cuz he was traveling under a false passport. But they didn't ask me about the map, so - I didn't tell 'em."
4754,the believer,I'm the only one who does believe. I see him for the power-drunk madman he is. And we're supposed to worship such a deity? I say never.
4755,the big lebowski,"Yes, Walter, you're right. There is an unspoken message here. It's ""FUCK YOU, LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!"" Yeah, I'll be at practice."
4756,the big lebowski,"Fifteen, Dude. This is it. Let's take that hill!"
4757,the big lebowski,My only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
4758,the big lebowski,"I just want to understand this, sir. Every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the owner?"
4759,the big lebowski,"Hey, careful, man, there's a beverage here!"
4760,the big lebowski,That rug really tied the room together.
4761,the big lebowski,"H-hey, this is a private residence, man!"
4762,the big lebowski,"Fuck it, Dude, let's go bowling."
4763,the big lebowski,"What's this day of rest shit? What's this bullshit? I don't fuckin' care! It don't matter to Jesus. But you're not foolin' me, man. You might fool the fucks in the league office, but you don't fool Jesus. This bush league psyche-out stuff. Laughable, man - ha ha! I would have fucked you in the ass Saturday. I fuck you in the ass next Wednesday instead. Wooo! You got a date Wednesday, baby!"
4764,the big lebowski,Darkness warshed over the Dude - darker'n a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night. There was no bottom.
4765,the big lebowski,At least I'm housebroken.

4770,the big lebowski,"Lady, I got buddies who died face down in the muck so that you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!"
4771,the big lebowski,Oh boy. How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm once they've seen Karl Hungus.
4772,the big lebowski,Where's the fucking money Lebowski?
4773,the big lebowski,They're gonna kill that poor woman.
4774,the big lebowski,The story is ludicrous.
4775,the big lebowski,"Walter, I love you, but sooner or later, you're going to have to face the fact you're a goddamn moron."
4776,the big lebowski,"He was innocent, not a charge was true, and they say he ran away... Branded!"
4777,the big lebowski,"That's right, Dude, they peed on your fucking rug."
4778,the big lebowski,"Leads, yeah, sure. I'll just check with the boys down at the crime lab, they've got four more detectives working on the case. They got us working in shifts!  Leads!  Leads..."
4779,the big lebowski,"Let me explain something to you. Um, I am not ""Mr. Lebowski"". You're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. You know, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing."
4780,the big lebowski,"Shut the fuck up, Donny."
4781,the big lebowski,"Whereas what we have here? A bunch of fig-eaters wearing towels on their heads, trying to find reverse in a Soviet tank. This is not a worthy adversary."

4788,the black dahlia,Poor Betty... her problem wasn't too many enimies; it was too many friends.
4789,the black dahlia,"Adios yourself back to the halls of Tripoli, shitbird, I've got business with the lady."
4790,the black dahlia,"Losing the first Bleichert-Blanchard fight got me local celebrity Warrants and close to nine grand in cash. Winning the rematch got me a sprained wrist, two dislocated knuckles, and the rest of the day off."
4791,the black dahlia,"Hearty fare breeds hearty people, haute cuisine breeds degenerates."
4792,the blast from the past,"Uh, Eve, this is Adam. Look, I just wanted to thank you for everything you did for me. And I wanted to tell you that I... that uh... that I wish so many good things for you. I wish so hard that all of your dreams come true, and... and that's all I... and that's all."

4796,the body snatcher,"I am a small man, a humble man. Being poor I have had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr McFarlane comes to my whistle, that long am I a man.

4800,the boondock saints,"Hey fuck-ass, give me a beer."
4801,the boondock saints,I'll catch you on the flip side.
4802,the boondock saints,"First of all, I'd like to thank whichever one of you donut-munching, barrel-assed, pud-pulling sissies leaked this to the press. That's just what we need now: some sensational story in the papers making these boys out to be superheroes, triumphing over evil. Let me squash the rumors now. These two are not heroes. They're just two ordinary men who were put in an extraordinary situation and they just happened to come out on top. Yes, nothing from our far-reaching computer system has turned up diddly on these two. All we know is what we found out from the neighbors, and the general consensus is, they're angels. But angels don't kill. And we got two bodies in the morgue that look like they've been ""serial-crushed by some huge friggin' guy""."
4803,the boondock saints,"You must watch, dear. It'll all be over soon."
4804,the boondock saints,"Now, you Irish cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men. Kind of makes me feel like Riverdancing."
4805,the boondock saints,The 90's are killing me. I shouldn't have done that. You're not supposed to tell a guy you're gonna kill him no more. I got to tiptoe through the tulips with these assholes. Taking all the fun out of the job.
4806,the boondock saints,"So Duffy, you got any theories to go with that... tie?"
4807,the boondock saints,"Oh, isn't that beautiful? All the lowlifes in quiet city Boston start dropping dead and *you* think it's unrelated! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police to do my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe!"

4825,the bourne ultimatum,"Our target is a British national - Simon Ross, a reporter. I want all his phones, his BlackBerry, his apartment, his car, bank accounts, credit cards, travel patterns - I want to know what he's going to think before he does.

4827,the bourne ultimatum,Turn off the tape recorder.
4828,the bourne ultimatum,"Listen, people - do you have any idea who you're dealing with? This is Jason Bourne. You are nine hours behind the toughest target you have ever tracked. Now I want everyone to sit down, strap in, and turn on all you've got. That would mean now."

Dear Mr. Vernon, We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. What we did *was* wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. What do you care? You see us as you want to see us - in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. Correct? That's the way we saw each other at 7:00 this morning. We were brainwashed."

4972,the exorcist,"Especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon. We may ask what is relevant but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar. The demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological, Damien, and powerful. So don't listen to him. Remember that - do not listen."

4977,the exorcist,Father Dyer? I thought you'd like to keep this.
4978,the exorcist,"So, what's for dessert?"
4979,the exorcist,"There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look, your daughter doesn't say she's a demon. She says she's the devil himself. And if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte."
4980,the exorcist,The Power of Christ compels you!

4998,the fisher king,I can't believe I'm on a first name basis with these peope!
4999,the fisher king,"I don't believe that God made man in his image. 'Cause most of the shit that happens comes from man. No, I think man was made in the Devil's image. And women were created out of God. 'Cause after all, women can have babies, which is kind of like creating. And which also accounts for the fact that women are so attracted to men... 'cause let's face it... the Devil is a hell of a lot more interesting! Believe me, I've slept with some saints in my day, I know what I'm talking about. So the whole point in life is for men and women to get married... so that God and the Devil can get together and work it out. Not that we have to get married. God forbid."
5000,the fisher king,Holding my penis... what a wonderful way of saying how much you like me.
5001,the fisher king,"You ever read any Nietzsche? Nietzsche says there's two kinds of people in the world: people who are destined for greatness like Walt Disney... and Hitler. Then there's the rest of us, he called us ""the bungled and the botched."" We get teased. We sometimes get close to greatness, but we never get there. We're the expendable masses. We get pushed in front of trains, take poison aspirin... get gunned down in Dairy Queens."
5002,the fisher king,"I'm Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Jack - I can't find my baby."
5003,the fisher king,I wish there was some way I could just pay the fine and go home.

5015,the good girl,"How it all came down to this, only the Devil knows. Retail Rodeo is at the corner on my left. The motel is down the road to my right. I close my eyes and try to peer into the future. On my left, I saw days upon days of lipstick and ticking clocks, dirty looks and quiet whisperings. And burning secrets that just won't ever die away. And on my right, what could I picture? The blue sky, the desert earth, stretching out into the eerie infinity. A beautiful never-ending nothing."
5016,the good girl,"As a girl you see the world as a giant candy store filled with sweet candy and such. But one day you look around and you see a prison and you're on death row. You wanna run or scream or cry but something's locking you up. Are the other folks cows chewing cud until the hour comes when their heads roll? Or are they just keeping quiet like you, planning their escape."
5017,the good girl,"If I were a woman, I'd be a slut. A lesbian slut."
5018,the good girl,"Dear Justine, because of you I will be quitting the Retail Rodeo. The last two days have been the most God awful of my life. I've not been able to get rid of you in my head. I've never wanted anything so bad and I have wanted many things. I'd given up long ago on being gotten by someone else, and then you came along. The idea that I could be gotten because of circumstantial never get got is the worst feeling I've ever felt and I have felt many bad feelings. I'm sorry I can never see you again, Justine. Forgive me for being so weak, but that is who I am. Goodbye. Holden Worther. If, for some reason, you could change your mind and wanna be with me body and soul, meet me after work. I will be waiting for you at 5pm outside Chunky Cheese. If you are not there at five you will never see me again in your lifetime."
5019,the good girl,"Holden gave me two of his stories to read. It was more like the story of what a story would be. It was about a boy who was put upon; whose mother is cold and selfish and whose father wanted him to play football. Other people didn't get him. Especiall girls. Soon enough the boy comes to believe that no one can ever really know him. He starts acting out, drinking and taking all kinds of drugs. At the end the boy kills himself by jumping over a bridge. The second story was pretty much the same as the first expect at the end the boy kills himself by drinking a bottle of bug poison."
5020,the good girl,"That day I read the story Holden had wrote for me. It was kinda different from the other ones but kinda the same. It was about a girl who was put upon, whose job is like a prison, and whose life has lost all meaning. Other people don't get her, especially her husband. One day she meets a boy who is also put upon and they fall in love. After spending their whole lives never getting got, with one look they get each other completely. In the end the girl and the boy run away together into the wilderness, never to be heard from again."
5021,the good girl,"Happy Halloween, Retail Rodeo shoppers. There's a Retail Rodeo special on all bulk candy on aisle 4. Ghouls and goblins, witches and warlocks, wandering these aisles day after day, I put a Halloween curse on your hellish heads."
5022,the good girl,If I could only get my hands on some money. If someone could just tell me the answer. I gotta do! But I don't ever do anything 'cos I end up thinking about it instead. I gotta do! But do what?
5023,the good girl,"You know, sometimes I think to myself: At least it can't get any worse. But it can! It can get worse! As long as you can say you hit rock bottom, you haven't."
5024,the good girl,"You're a hooker, you hooker."
5025,the good girl,"After living in the dark for so long, a glimpse of the light can make you giddy. Strange thoughts come into your head and you better think'em. Has a special fate been calling you and you not listening? Is there a secret message right in front of you and you're not reading it? Is this your last, best chance? Are you gonna take it? Or are you going to the grave with unlived lives in your veins?"
5026,the graduate,"Look, maybe we could do something else together. Mrs. Robinson, would you like to go to a movie?"
5027,the graduate,"Mrs. Robinson, if you don't mind my saying so, this conversation is getting a little strange."
5028,the graduate,"Do you need any gas, Father?"
5029,the grapes of wrath,Sure don't look none too prosperous.
5030,the grapes of wrath,That Casy. He might have been a preacher but he seen things clear. He was like a lantern. He helped me to see things clear.
5031,the grapes of wrath,You and me got sense. Them Okies got no sense and no feeling. They ain't human. Human being wouldn't live the way they do. Human being couldn't stand to be so miserable.
5032,the grapes of wrath,"Takes no nerve to do something, ain't nothin' else you can do."
5033,the grapes of wrath,"There ain't nobody gonna push me of my land! My grandpa took up this land 70 years ago, my pa was born here, we were all born on it. And some of of us was killed on it! ...and some of us died on it. That's what make it our'n, bein' born on it,...and workin' on it,...and and dying' on it! And not no piece of paper with the writin' on it!"
5034,the grapes of wrath,"If there was a law, they was workin' with maybe we could take it, but it ain't the law. They're workin' away our spirits, tryin' to make us cringe and crawl, takin' away our decency."
5035,the grapes of wrath,"Tom, you gotta learn like I'm learnin'. I don't know it right yet myself. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preachers gotta know. I don't know. I gotta ask."
5036,the grapes of wrath,"Well, Pa, a woman can change better'n a man. A man lives sorta - well, in jerks. Baby's born or somebody dies, and that's a jerk. He gets a farm or loses it, and that's a jerk. With a woman, it's all in one flow, like a stream - little eddies and waterfalls - but the river, it goes right on. Woman looks at it thata way."
5037,the grapes of wrath,"Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good an' they die out. But we keep a'comin'. We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out; they can't lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa, 'cause we're the people."

5042,the green mile,"He's chokin'. Whatever he sucked out of her, he's choking on!"
5043,the green mile,"They usually call death row the Last Mile, but we called ours the Green Mile, because the floor was the color of faded limes. We had the electric chair then. Old Sparky, we called it. I've lived a lot of years, Ellie, but 1935 takes the prize. That was the year I had the worst urinary infection of my life. That was also the year of John Coffey and the two dead girls."
5044,the green mile,We'll be doing this for real tomorrow night and I don't want nobody to remember some stupid joke like that and get it going again. You ever try to not to laugh in church when something funny gets stuck in your head? Same goddamn thing.
5045,the green mile,"You love your sister? You make any noise, you know what happens. I'm gonna kill her instead of you. Understand?"
5046,the green mile,"Seeing a man die isn't enough for you, you gotta be close enough to smell his nuts cook?"
5047,the green mile,"I guess sometimes the past just catches up with you, whether you want it to or not."
5048,the green mile,"Please boss, don't put that thing over my face, don't put me in the dark. I's afraid of the dark."
5049,the green mile,A big man is ripping your ears off Percy. I'd do as he says.
5050,the green mile,"We each owe a death - there are no exceptions - but, oh God, sometimes the Green Mile seems so long."
5051,the green mile,Wipe your face before you get up Dean.
5052,the green mile,"The man is mean, careless, and stupid. Bad combination in a place like this."
5053,the green mile,I let Harry take those chains off you... you gonna be nice?
5054,the green mile,"I couldn't help it, boss. I tried to take it back, but it was too late."
5055,the green mile,I think this boy's cheese has done slid off his cracker.
5056,the green mile,"It's a tumor, Paul. A brain tumor. They got x-ray pictures of it. The size of a lemon, they said... way deep down inside where they can't operate. I haven't told her. I can't think of how. For the life of me, Paul, I can't think of how to tell my wife... she's going to die."
5057,the green mile,Do you leave a light on after bedtime? Because I get a little scared in the dark sometimes. If it's a strange place.
5058,the green mile,"I dreamed of you. I dreamed you were wandering in the dark, and so was I. We found each other. We found each other in the dark."
5059,the green mile,I don't see why white man has to sit in a nigger electric chair. White man should have his own damn electric chair.
5060,the green mile,"Honey, if you don't tell me what's on your mind, I'm afraid I'll have to smother you with a pillow."
5061,the grifters,"Well, who's a boy gonna talk to if not his mother?"
5062,the grifters,"The last modern thing I liked was the miniskirt. With technology now, nobody understands it... and that's the simple fact of the situation."
5063,the grifters,I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once.
5064,the grudge,The whole time I was in that house I felt something was wrong. What happened there?
5065,the grudge,I just want her to leave me alone!
5066,the hangover,"It's the weekend, Budnick. I don't know you. You do not exist."

5068,the hangover,And we're the three best friends that anyone could have!
5069,the haunting,"Oh, come on this is crazy; maybe she doesn't want to be found."
5070,the haunting,You find out what you wanted to know... doctor?
5071,the haunting,Eleanor help me! I gotta pee!

5076,the hebrew hammer,"I hope you've all learned a very important lesson today. Just because Mordechai's people are different from us, and just because they may appear strange to us with their furry hats, beady eyes, and long sideburns, not to mention their bizarre customs and unnecessarily gutteral funny-sounding names. Just because they control ALL of the world's money, yet they are too cheap to buy their children anything better than spinning tops for presents, does not mean that we can't learn to love and respect them as our equals. Happy chanuyakah day 7, Mordy!"

5086,the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy,"Vogon poetry is the third worst in the Universe. The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem ""Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning"" four of his audience members died of internal hemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off.

5092,the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy,"Vogons. They are one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy. Not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious, and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the ravenous Bug-Blatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, lost, found, queried, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighter.

5096,the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy,"They don't think, they don't imagine, most of them can't even spell, they just run things. And if we don't hitch a ride soon, you won't need the guide to tell you just how unpleasant they can be. They already destroyed a planet today, and that always makes them a little... eeee!"
5097,the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy,I should have said it resembles tea.
5098,the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy,That doesn't sound good.

Like when you smell things, because when you smell a smell it's not really a smell, it's a part of the object that has come off of it, molecules. So when you smell something bad, it's like in a way you're eating it. This is why you should not really smell things, in the same way that you don't eat everything in the world around you because as a smell, it gets inside of you. So the next time you go into the bathroom after someone else has been there, remember what kinds of molecules you are in fact eating."

But what you're going through goes on day in and day out. Whether you're ready for it or not, week in, week out. Month after month after month. Whether you're up or whether you're down. You're assaulted psychologically. You're assaulted financially, which is its own special kind of violence because it's directed at your kids. What school can you afford? How will that affect their lives? You're asking yourself, ""Will that limit what they may become?"" You feel your whole family's future's compromised, held hostage. I do know how it is."

And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!"

5178,the invention of lying,"Hi, I'm Bob I'm the spokesperson for the Coca-Cola company. I'm here today to ask you to continue buying coke. Sure it's a drink you've been drinking for years, and if you still enjoy it, I'd like to remind you to buy it again sometime soon. It's basically just brown sugar water, we haven't changed the ingredients much lately, so there's nothing new I can tell you about that. We changed the can around a little bit though. See, the colors here are different there, and we added a polar bear so the kids like us. Coke is very high in sugar and like any high calorie soda it can lead to obesity in children and adults who don't sustain a very healthy diet. So that's it, it's coke. It's very famous, everyone knows it. I'm Bob, I work for coke, and I'm asking you to not stop buying coke. That's all.It's a bit sweet. Thank you."

5215,the last samurai,"My ancestors have ruled Japan for 2,000 years. And for all that time we have slept. During my sleep I have dreamed. I dreamed of a unified Japan.

5253,the lost world: jurassic park,"Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions: first, I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is. All you have to do is sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day. Second condition: my fee? You can keep it. All I want in return for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs. A male, a buck only. How and when is my business. Now if you don't like either of those conditions, you're on your own. So go ahead, set up base camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a Rex nest for all I care. But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas, OK?"

5259,the lost world: jurassic park,Now you're John Hammond.
5260,the man who knew too much,"You have muddled everything from the start, taking that child with you from Marrakesh. Don't you realize that Americans dislike having their children stolen?"
5261,the man who knew too much,"Sorry we were gone so long, but we had to pick up Hank!"
5262,the man who knew too much,"If you ever get hungry, our garden back home is full of snails. We tried everything to get rid of them. We never thought of a Frenchman!"
5263,the man who knew too much,A man... a statesman... is to be killed... assassinated in London. Soon... very soon. Tell them in London... tell them to try Ambrose Chapel...
5264,the man who wasn't there,"I was the principal barber now. I hired a new man for the second chair. I'd hired the guy who did the least gabbing when he came in for an interview, but I guess the new man had only kept quiet because he was nervous. Once he had the job he talked from the minute I opened the shop in the morning until I locked up at night. For all I know, he talked to himself on the way home."
5265,the man who wasn't there,"Yeah, I worked in a barbershop, but I never considered myself a barber. I stumbling into it. Or married into it, more precisely."
5266,the man who wasn't there,What kind of a man are you?
5267,the man who wasn't there,"You say he was being blackmailed, by who? You don't know. For having an affair, with who? You don't know. Did anyone else know about it? Probably not, you don't know."
5268,the man who wasn't there,"Japs had us pinned down in Buna for something like six weeks. Well, I gotta tell ya, I thought *we* had it tough, but, Jesus, we had supply. *They* were eating grubs, nuts, thistles. When we finally up and bust off the beach we found Arnie Bragg, kid missing on recon; the Japs had *eaten* the sonofabitch, if you'll pardon the, uh... And this was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin' to write home about. I mean, I never would've, ya know, so what do I say, honey? When I don't like dinner, what do I say? I say, 'Jesus, honey, Arnie Bragg - *again*'?"
5269,the man who wasn't there,"Me, I don't talk much... I just cut the hair"
5270,the man who wasn't there,"There they were. All going about their business. It seemed like I knew a secret, a bigger one even than what had really happened to Big Dave. Something none of them knew. Like I had made it to the outside somehow, and they were all still struggling way down below."
5271,the man who wasn't there,"It was only a couple weeks later she suggested getting married. I said, ""Don't you want to get to know me more?"" She said, ""Why? Does it get better?"" She looked at me like I was a dope, which I never really minded from her. And she had a point, I guess. We knew each other as well then as now. Anyway, well enough."
5272,the man who wasn't there,My wife and I have not performed the sex act in many years.
5273,the man who wasn't there,"I went to see a woman who was supposed to have powers of communicating with those who had ""passed across"" as she called it. She said that people who had passed across were picky about who they communicated with, not like most people you run into on this side. So you needed a guide, someone with a gift for talking to souls."
5274,the man who wasn't there,I'm all shot to hell.
5275,the man who wasn't there,"They got this guy, in Germany. Fritz Something-or-other. Or is it? Maybe it's Werner. Anyway, he's got this theory, you wanna test something, you know, scientifically - how the planets go round the sun, what sunspots are made of, why the water comes out of the tap - well, you gotta look at it. But sometimes you look at it, your looking changes it. Ya can't know the reality of what happened, or what would've happened if you hadn't-a stuck in your own goddamn schnozz. So there is no ""what happened""? Not in any sense that we can grasp, with our puny minds. Because our minds... our minds get in the way. Looking at something changes it. They call it the ""Uncertainty Principle"". Sure, it sounds screwy, but even Einstein says the guy's on to something."
5276,the man who wasn't there,Sooner or later everyone needs a haircut.
5277,the manchurian candidate,"The assassin always dies, baby. It's necessary for the national healing."
5278,the manchurian candidate,"Hello, Captain. Do you remember me?"
5279,the manchurian candidate,"Somebody got into our heads with big steel-toe boots, cable cutters and a chainsaw and they went to town. Neurons got got got exposed and circuits got rewired. Our brain cells got obliterated, Raymond."
5280,the mask,"No Milo, not the *cheese*... The *keys*!"
5281,the mask,"50 grand. 50 grand to the man who finds that green-faced son of a bitch before the cops do. I want you to get the word out to every street hustler, to every lowlife in this town, you understand? I want him here tomorrow, alive."
5282,the mask,"Start dancing, and I'll blow your brains out!"
5283,the mask,"The money better be here, Ipkiss. Or you're gonna ""Ipkiss"" your ass goodbye."
5284,the mask,"Genius. That was genius. Buddy, I have chills! What side of whose bed did you wake up on, man?"
5285,the mask,Do you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town? Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood.
5286,the matrix,"I hate this place. This zoo. This prison. This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it."
5287,the matrix,"Tell me, Mr. Anderson, what good is a phone call when you are unable to speak?"
5288,the matrix,Welcome to the desert of the real.

5292,the matrix,Neo. You scared the b'Jesus out of me.
5293,the matrix,"The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson. Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth, or you choose to find yourself another job."
5294,the matrix,"Good shit, huh? It's good for two things: degreasing engines and killing brain cells."
5295,the matrix,"Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."
5296,the matrix,Never send a human to do a machine's job.
5297,the matrix,"You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize?  Ignorance is bliss."
5298,the matrix,"As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson."
5299,the matrix,"What is ""real""? How do you define ""real""?"
5300,the matrix,Remember... all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.
5301,the matrix,Welcome to the real world.
5302,the matrix,Mr. Wizard. Get me the hell out of here.
5303,the men who stare at goats,It's the Silence of the Goats!
5304,the men who stare at goats,Now more than ever we need the Jedi.
5305,the men who stare at goats,"Every single one of Bill's soldiers fired high. They instinctively hadn't wanted to shoot another person. Later Bill would come across a study which revealed that only 15-20% of fresh soldiers shot to kill. The rest aimed high, didn't fire at all, or pretended to be busy doing something else."
5306,the men who stare at goats,More of this is true than you would believe.
5307,the mummy,"Oh, yeah. This just keeps gettin' better and better."
5308,the mummy,"Here I come, laddies! Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
5309,the mummy,Stupid superstitious bastard.
5310,the mummy,Time to close the door.
5311,the mummy,Abdul?  Mohammed? ... Bob?
5312,the mummy,"Mister O'Connell, can you look me in the eye, and guarantee me that this isn't all some kind of a flimflam?"
5313,the mummy,We are in serious trouble.
5314,the mummy,It is better to be the right hand of the devil than in his path.
5315,the mummy,Oh my God it's a... it's a sarcophagus. Buried at the base of Anubis. He must have been someone of great importance. Or he did something *very* naughty.
5316,the mummy,"Forget it. We're out the door, we're down the hall and we're gone."
5317,the mummy,Death is only the beginning.
5318,the mummy,"I only gamble with my life, never my money."

5324,the night of the hunter,It's a hard world for little things.
5325,the night of the hunter,"Salvation is a last-minute business, boy."

5327,the night of the hunter,"You know, when you're little, you have more endurance than God is ever to grant you again. Children are man at his strongest. They abide."
5328,the night of the hunter,"I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this here Depression, children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies in junk heaps. And I promised myself that I'd never see the day when my young-uns had want."
5329,the night of the hunter,"Child... You were looking for love, Ruby, in the only foolish way you knew how."
5330,the night of the hunter,She'll not be back. I reckon I'm safe in promising you that.
5331,the night of the hunter,A woman's a fool to marry for that. That's somethin' for a man. The Good Lord never meant for a decent woman to want that. Not really want it. It's all just a fake and a pipe dream.
5332,the night of the hunter,Women are such durn fools.
5333,the night of the hunter,When you've been married to a man for forty years you know all that don't amount to a hill of beans. I've been married to Walt that long and I swear in all that time I just lie there thinkin' about my canning.
5334,the night of the hunter,"No, no! Don't you touch that, little lamb. Don't touch my knife, that makes me mad. That makes me very, very mad."
5335,the night of the hunter,"They abide, and they endure."

5364,the nines,"And then I met the most wonderful boy in the world. We would take long walks by the river. We spent hours gazing into each other's eyes. We were so very much in love. And then one day, he went away. And I thought I'd die, but I didn't. And when I didn't, I said to myself ""is that all there is to love?"""

5381,the patriot,I'm a parent. I haven't got the luxury of principles.
5382,the patriot,"Would you like a lesson, sir, in the rules of war? Or perhaps your children would?"
5383,the pianist,"Here, sell this. Food is more important than time."
5384,the pianist,"20 zloty, that's all we have left, 20 zolty. What can I buy with 20 zloty? I am sick of cooking potatoes, potatoes, potatoes."
5385,the pianist,"I told her not to worry, you had your papers on you. If you'd been hit by a bomb, they'd have known where to take you."
5386,the pianist,What... what do you think you'll do while you're setting up your new line of defense? Wander around luggin' your suitcases?
5387,the pianist,"Majorek, this is the greatest pianist in Poland, maybe the whole world."
5388,the pianist,"2,000 and my advice is to take it. What will you do when you're hungry? Eat the piano?"
5389,the pianist,"Well, to tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse."
5390,the pianist,Majorek used to be in the army. Brilliant man. The only thing I've got against him is he's not a socialist.
5391,the pianist,"And the Germans claim to be intelligent! You know what I think, I think they are totally stupid. I have a family to feed. I spend half my time here, waiting for them to let us through. Why do they think I come here, to listen to the music?"
5392,the pianist,"Ah, more Jewish police. You mean you want me to beat up Jews and catch the Gestapo spirit? I see."
5393,the piano,What a death! What a chance! What a surprise! My will has chosen life! Still it has had me spooked and many others besides!
5394,the piano,"One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall, and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lighting came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch. And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She never spoke another word."
5395,the piano,Undo your dress. I want to see your arms. Play. Two keys.
5396,the piano,"At night! I think of my piano in its ocean grave, and sometimes of myself floating above it. Down there everything is so still and silent that it lulls me to sleep. It is a weird lullaby and so it is; it is mine."
5397,the piano,"I have given the piano back to you. I've had enough. The arrangement is making you a whore, and me, wretched. I want you to care for me. But you can't. It's yours, leave. Go on, go."
5398,the piano,I want to lie together without clothes on.
5399,the planet of the apes,The question is not so much where we are as when we are.

5401,the planet of the apes,Who would like to buy some aspirin?
5402,the planet of the apes,"You know the saying, ""Human see, human do."""
5403,the planet of the apes,"Have you forgotten your scripture, the thirteenth scroll? ""And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree and the children did make sport of him."""
5404,the planet of the apes,You are a menace. A walking pestilence.
5405,the planet of the apes,"Nine or ten pints of scrumpy, that's what I want; I've lost a lot of blood!"
5406,the planet of the apes,"Doctor, would an ape make a human doll that TALKS?"
5407,the planet of the apes,"All right, get 'em out and get 'em clean! Chop chop!"
5408,the planet of the apes,"You are right, I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand and hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike creature who gives battle to everything around him, even himself."
5409,the planet of the apes,"Beware the beast Man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death."
5410,the planet of the apes,"Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us."
5411,the planet of the apes,"The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago."

5416,the postman,I have a feeling about you. I know you'll do what's right.
5417,the postman,I know what your problem is. Do you know why you won't fight? Because you have nothing to fight for! You don't care about anything! You don't value anything! You don't believe in anything! That's what makes me better!
5418,the postman,This is your daughter... her name is Hope.
5419,the postman,It's gotta be the uniform.
5420,the postman,Wouldn't it be great if wars could be fought just by the assholes who started them?
5421,the postman,You made Mrs. March feel like she could see again. You made Ford believe he was part of something. You give out hope like it was candy in your pocket.
5422,the postman,Law one. You will obey orders without question. Law two: Punishment shall be swift. Law three: Mercy is for the weak. Four: Terror will defeat reason. Five: Your allegiance is to the clan. Six: Justice can be dictated. Seven: Any clansman may challenge for leadership of the clan. Law eight: There is only one penalty. Death.
5423,the postman,"Once more into the breach, my friends, once more. We'll close the wall with our dead. In peace, nothing so becomes a man as modesty and humility, but when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger, summon up the blood, disguise fair nature with rage and lend the eye a terrible aspect."
5424,the postman,U.S. Mail... Restored United States... Do these people really believe that shit?
5425,the princess bride,"Beautiful isn't it? It took me half a lifetime to invent it. I'm sure you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain. Presently I'm writing the definitive work on the subject, so I want you to be totally honest with me on how the machine makes you feel. This being our first try, I'll use the lowest setting.   As you know, the concept of the suction pump is centuries old. Really that's all this is except that instead of sucking water, I'm sucking life. I've just sucked one year of your life away. I might one day go as high as five, but I really don't know what that would do to you. So, let's just start with what we have. What did this do to you? Tell me. And remember, this is for posterity so be honest. How do you feel?  Interesting."
5426,the princess bride,"We are men of action, lies do not become us."
5427,the princess bride,"Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire. He took me to his cabin and he told me his secret. 'I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts' he said. 'My name is Ryan; I inherited the ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts, just as you will inherit it from me. The man I inherited it from is not the real Dread Pirate Roberts either. His name was Cummerbund. The real Roberts has been retired 15 years and living like a king in Patagonia.'"
5428,the princess bride,Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
5429,the princess bride,There will be blood tonight!
5430,the princess bride,There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world. It would be a pity to damage yours.
5431,the princess bride,You must be that little Spanish brat I taught a lesson to all those years ago. You've been chasing me your whole life only to fail now? I think that's about the worst thing I've ever heard.  How marvelous.
5432,the princess bride,I will never love again.
5433,the princess bride,"I do not budge; keep your ""ho there""."
5434,the princess bride,You be careful. People in masks cannot be trusted.
5435,the princess bride,"Kill the giant and the dark one, leave the third for questioning."
5436,the princess bride,"That was a warning, Highness. Next time my hand flies on its own. Where I come from, there are penalties when a woman lies."
5437,the princess bride,"You mocked me once, never do it again! I died that day!"
5438,the princess bride,He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
5439,the princess bride,They're kissing again. Do we have to read the kissing parts?
5440,the princess bride,"I do not envy you the headache you will have when you awake. But for now, rest well and dream of large women."

5476,the reader,"The notion of secrecy is central to western literature. You may say, the whole idea of character is defined by people holding specific information which for various reasons, sometimes perverse, sometimes noble, they are determined not to disclose."
5477,the reader,"I'm not frightened. I'm not frightened of anything. The more I suffer, the more I love. Danger will only increase my love. It will sharpen it, forgive its vice. I will be the only angel you need. You will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it. Heaven will take you back and look at you and say: Only one thing can make a soul complete and that thing is love."

5542,the shawshank redemption,"You could argue he'd done it to curry favor with the guards. Or, maybe make a few friends among us cons. Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again, if only for a short while."
5543,the shawshank redemption,Andy Dufresne - who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side.
5544,the shawshank redemption,"I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled, like a man in a park without a care or a worry in the world, like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say... I liked Andy from the start."

5552,the shawshank redemption,Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind!
5553,the shawshank redemption,I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him; looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over. That was my first impression of the man.
5554,the shawshank redemption,"His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes. He never made a sound."

5582,the siege,"Make no mistake, Senator. We will hunt down the enemy, we will find the enemy, and we will kill the enemy. And no card-carrying member of the ACLU is more dead set against it than I am. Which is why I urge you - I implore you. Do not consider this as an option."
5583,the sixth sense,You were keeping her sick.
5584,the sixth sense,Look at my face; I was not thinking anything bad about you.
5585,the sixth sense,"Silence, village idiot!"
5586,the sixth sense,Stop looking at me. I don't like people looking at me like that.
5587,the sixth sense,I want to tell you my secret now.
5588,the sixth sense,Look at my face; I'm not very mad.
5589,the sixth sense,"Anna Crowe, I am in love... in love I am."
5590,the sixth sense,I thought you meant the other Italian restaurant I asked you to marry me in.
5591,the sixth sense,"I would like some wine in a glass, I would not like it in a mug, I would not like it in a jug."
5592,the sixth sense,"De profundis clamo ad te, domine."
5593,the sixth sense,I'm ready to communicate with you now.
5594,the sixth sense,Do you know why you're afraid when you're alone? I do. I do.
5595,the sixth sense,I thought Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
5596,the sixth sense,I think I'm okay really. I think it just went in and out. I... It doesn't even hurt anymore.
5597,the sixth sense,Did he have wavy hair and chestnut eyes?
5598,the sixth sense,"If you could change something in your life, anything at all, what would it be?"
5599,the sixth sense,Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
5600,the sixth sense,I didn't know you were funny.
5601,the sixth sense,"Hey, come on! I'll show you where my dad keeps his gun. Come on!"
5602,the sixth sense,You can't hurt me anymore!
5603,the sting,Sorry I'm late. I was taking a crap.
5604,the sting,Luther said I could learn some things from you. I already know how to drink.
5605,the sting,"You're right, Henry. It's not enough. But  it's close!"
5606,the sting,"Sit down and shut up, will ya? Try not to live up to all my expectations."
5607,the sweet hereafter,"I did not have to go as far as I was prepared to go, but I was prepared to go all the way."
5608,the sweet hereafter,"You'd make a good poker player, kid."
5609,the thin man,"Waiter, will you serve the nuts? I mean, will you serve the guests the nuts?"
5610,the thin man,Now don't make a move or that dog will tear you to shreds.
5611,the thin man,The murderer is right in this room. Sitting at this table. You may serve the fish.
5612,the thin man,"Oh, Nicky, I love you because you know such lovely people."
5613,the thin man,Haven't you heard the news? I'm a gentleman now!
5614,the thin man,What's that man doing in my drawers?
5615,the thing,I just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit!
5616,the thing,"Anybody touches me, and we go!"
5617,the thing,I was wonderin' when El Capitan was gonna get a chance to use his popgun.
5618,the thing,"I dunno what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is."
5619,the thing,"I know you gentlemen have been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS FUCKING COUCH!"
5620,the thing,Maybe we're at war with Norway?
5621,the thing,"You guys gonna listen to Garry? You gonna let him give the orders? I mean, he could BE one of those things!"
5622,the third man,"I'd make comic faces... and stand on my head and grin at you between my legs... and tell all sorts of jokes. I wouldn't stand a chance, would I?"
5623,the third man,"You know, you ought to get yourself a girl."
5624,the third man,We should have dug deeper than a grave.
5625,the third man,"Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly."
5626,the third man,"That's a nice girl, that. But she ought to go careful in Vienna. Everybody ought to go careful in a city like this."
5627,the third man,"He is now  in hell, or  in heaven."
5628,the third man,A person doesn't change just because you find out more.
5629,the three musketeers,"Come D'Artagnan, we're saving the King!"
5630,the three musketeers,A truly remarkable woman. The most beautiful I have ever known. And the deadliest... which would explain my attraction.
5631,the three musketeers,There was a time when I would have given my life for a kind word from you.
5632,the three musketeers,"By joint edict of His Majesty King Louis XIII and His Eminence Cardinal Richelieu, the Musketeers are officially disbanded. In preparation for the coming war with England, your ranks and commissions are hereby transferred to the Infantry. You will be contacted and told where to report. Until that time, you are instructed to return to your homes."
5633,the three musketeers,The King's life is in danger. We have work to do.
5634,the three musketeers,That's it. Next time you drive.
5635,the time machine,"When I speak of time, I'm speaking of the fourth dimension."
5636,the truman show,"We've become bored with watching actors give us phony emotions. We are tired of pyrotechnics and special effects. While the world he inhabits is, in some respects, counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts, no cue cards. It isn't always Shakespeare, but it's genuine. It's a life."
5637,the usual suspects,"Back when I was picking beans in Guatemala, we used to make fresh coffee, right off the trees I mean. That was good. This is shit but, hey, I'm in a police station."
5638,the usual suspects,There's nothing that can't be done.
5639,the usual suspects,"What about it, pretzel man, what's your story?"
5640,the usual suspects,You give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.
5641,the usual suspects,"It's not payback! It's precaution. You want payback? You wanna run? I don't care! I'm not doing this for Fenster, I'm not doing it for you... I'm doing it for me. I'm gonna finish this thing. This Kobayashi bastard is not gonna stand on me!"
5642,the usual suspects,Can you hear me in the back? Hello?
5643,the usual suspects,"The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher."
5644,the usual suspects,"First day on the job, you know what I learned? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. You put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever's sleeping is your man. You see, if you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest, you let your guard down."
5645,the usual suspects,I'll probably shit blood tonight.
5646,the usual suspects,"It didn't make sense that I'd be there. I mean, these guys were hard-core hijackers, but there I was. At that point I wasn't scared, I knew I hadn't done anything they could do me for. Besides, it was fun. I got to make like I was notorious."
5647,the usual suspects,He was dead just long enough for the murder rap to blow over. And then he had lunch.
5648,the usual suspects,"Get your rest, Gentlemen. The boat will be ready for you on Friday. If I see you or any of your friends before then, Miss. Finneran will find herself the victim of a most gruesome violation before she dies. As will your father, Mr. Hockney. and your Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr. Kint. I might only castrate Mr. McManus's nephew, David. Do I make myself clear?"
5649,the usual suspects,"Why are you just standing there, you idiot? I'm not speaking English am I? Wouldn't it make sense to find someone who could talk to me so you could find the person that set me on fire, perhaps? He is the Devil. You've never seen anyone like Keyser Soze in all your miserable life, you idiot. Keyser Soze. Do you at least understand that? Keyser Soze. The Devil himself. Or are you American policemen so stupid that you haven't even heard of him? Keyser Soze, you ridiculous man. KEYSER SOZE."
5650,the usual suspects,There's no fucking coke.
5651,the usual suspects,"Keaton always said, ""I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him."" Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze."
5652,the usual suspects,I just can't believe we're going to walk into certain death.
5653,the usual suspects,"It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back? What if you miss?"
5654,the usual suspects,"McManus came to us with the job, Fenster got the vans, Hockney supplied the hardware, I came through with how to do it so no one got killed, but Keaton... Keaton put on the finishing touch. A little 'fuck you' from the five of us to the NYPD."
5655,the usual suspects,"If I told you the Loch Ness monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?"
5656,the verdict,"After the operation, when that poor girl she went into a coma, Dr. Towler called me in. He told me that he'd had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired... and he never looked at the admittance form. And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the '1' to a '9'... or else... or else he said, he said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again. Who were these men? Who were these men? I wanted to be a nurse!"
5657,the verdict,"I know how you feel. You don't believe me, but I do know. I'm going to tell you something that I learned when I was your age. I'd prepared a case and old man White said to me, ""How did you do?"" And, uh, I said, ""Did my best."" And he said, ""You're not paid to do your best. You're paid to win."" And that's what pays for this office... pays for the pro bono work that we do for the poor... pays for the type of law that you want to practice... pays for my whiskey... pays for your clothes... pays for the leisure we have to sit back and discuss philosophy as we're doing tonight. We're paid to win the case. You finished your marriage. You wanted to come back and practice the law. You wanted to come back to the world. Welcome back."
5658,the verdict,"You know, so much of the time we're just lost. We say, ""Please, God, tell us what is right; tell us what is true."" And there is no justice: the rich win, the poor are powerless. We become tired of hearing people lie. And after a time, we become dead... a little dead. We think of ourselves as victims... and we become victims. We become... we become weak. We doubt ourselves, we doubt our beliefs. We doubt our institutions. And we doubt the law. But today you are the law. You ARE the law. Not some book... not the lawyers... not the, a marble statue... or the trappings of the court. See those are just symbols of our desire to be just. They are... they are, in fact, a prayer: a fervent and a frightened prayer. In my religion, they say, ""Act as if ye had faith... and faith will be given to you."" IF... if we are to have faith in justice, we need only to believe in ourselves. And ACT with justice. See, I believe there is justice in our hearts."
5659,the verdict,"You guys... you guys are all the same! The doctors at the hospital, you... it's always what I'm going to do for you. And then you screw up, and it's, ""Ah, we did the best that we could, I'm dreadfully sorry."" And people like us live with your mistakes the rest of our lives."
5660,the verdict,You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... No nothing... You're a bunch of whores.
5661,the verdict,This case should never have come to trial. But you know better. You're mister independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I have no sympathy for you.
5662,the visitor,Don't Worry. I'll keep my pants on.
5663,the wedding date,Nothing that a bottle of Jack and a straight razor won't fix.
5664,the wedding date,"Mom, this is so not the time to be yourself."
5665,the wedding date,"I look like a total wanker, don't I?"
5666,the wedding date,The only thing that you two have in common is that you're both secretly attracted to me.
5667,the wedding date,"Oh sweet Jesus, who gave that woman an amp?"
5668,the wedding date,"Well thank you for including me in this timeless feminine ritual. Here's to the husbands who've won you, the losers who've lost you, and the lucky bastards who've yet to meet you."
5669,the wedding date,"The Wedding Dance is a timeless ritual... Surrounded by a group of family and friends. Watching, smiling, taking bets on how long it's going to last. All your have is each other and whatever skills you aquire today."
5670,the wedding date,I'd rather fight with you than make love with anyone else.
5671,the wedding date,Wait a minute! You're telling me that *if* something happened last night I would have to pay you $1700! That's a down payment on a Ford Focus!
5672,the wedding date,"Let me teach you a trick: if you look people in the eye, they won't notice what you're wearing."
5673,the wedding date,"Go ahead, Kat, hate me. I think you're running out of steam on this whole Jeffrey thing anyhow. Maybe now you'll be able to hold on to this long enough to ruin your next relationship."
5674,the wild bunch,"If they move, kill 'em!"
5675,the wild bunch,"Pike; ""I wouldn't have it any other way"", *either*!"
5676,the wild bunch,"Well, how'd you like to kiss my sister's black cat's ass?"
5677,the wild bunch,"What I like, and what I need, are two different things."
5678,the wild bunch,"Do not drink wine or strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, least ye shall die. Look not though upon the wine when it is red, and when it bringeth his color in the cup, when it moveth itself aright at the last, it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder. Now folks, that's from the Good Book, but in this here town it's five cents a glass."
5679,the wild bunch,"We all dream of being a child again, even the worst of us. Perhaps the worst most of all."
5680,the wizard of oz,What would you do with a brain if you had one?
5681,the wizard of oz,"Oh, but anyway, Toto, we're home. Home! And this is my room, and you're all here. And I'm not gonna leave here ever, ever again, because I love you all, and - oh, Auntie Em - there's no place like home!"
5682,the wizard of oz,"As Coroner I must aver, I thoroughly examined her, and she's not only merely dead, she's really most sincerely dead."
5683,the wizard of oz,"Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows!"
5684,the wizard of oz,"Unusual weather we're having, ain't it?"
5685,the wizard of oz,"How about a little fire, Scarecrow?"
5686,the wizard of oz,Where do you want to be oiled first?
5687,the wizard of oz,"Put 'em up, put 'em up! Which one of you first? I'll fight you both together if you want. I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back. I'll fight you standing on one foot. I'll fight you with my eyes closed... ohh, pullin' an axe on me, eh? Sneaking up on me, eh? Why, I'll... Ruff!"
5688,the wizard of oz,"Better get under cover, Sylvester. There's a storm blowin' up - a whopper, to speak in the vernacular of the peasantry. Poor little kid, I hope she gets home all right."
5689,the wizard of oz,"She isn't coming yet, Toto. Did she hurt you? She tried to, didn't she? Come on. We'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em."
5690,the wizard of oz,"Ring around the rosie, a pocket full of spears! Thought you were pretty foxy, didn't you? Well! The last to go will see the first three go before her! And your mangy little dog, too!"
5691,the wizard of oz,"Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity. Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the Earth or slinks through slimy seas has a brain. Back where I come from, we have universities, seats of great learning, where men go to become great thinkers. And when they come out, they think deep thoughts and with no more brains than you have. But they have one thing you haven't got: a diploma."
5692,the wizard of oz,My! People come and go so quickly here!
5693,the wizard of oz,"You cursed brat! Look what you've done! I'm melting! melting! Oh, what a world! What a world! Who would have thought a good little girl like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness? Oooooh, look out! I'm going! Oooooh! Ooooooh!"
5694,the wizard of oz,"Come on, everybody to the storm cellar!"
5695,the wizard of oz,A heart is not judged by how much you love; but by how much you are loved by others.
5696,the wizard of oz,Do not arouse the wrath of the great and powerful Oz. I said come back tomorrow.
5697,the wizard of oz,"Orders are nobody can see the Great Oz! Not nobody, not nohow!"
5698,the wizard of oz,"Back where I come from there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds. They are called phila... er, phila... er, yes, er, Good Deed Doers."
5699,the wizard of oz,"Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county doesn't mean that you have the power to run the rest of us. For twenty-three years, I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you! And now... well, being a Christian woman, I can't say it!"
5700,the wizard of oz,Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.
5701,the wizard of oz,I am the great and powerful... ... Wizard of Oz.
5702,the wizard of oz,"Lions, and tigers, and bears! Oh, my!"
5703,the wizard of oz,I can barely hear my heart beating!
5704,the wizard of oz,"To confer, converse, and otherwise hob-nob with my brother wizards."
5705,the wizard of oz,"You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death, sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified."
5706,the wizard of oz,"Read what my medal says: ""Courage"". Ain't it the truth? Ain't it the truth?"
5707,the wizard of oz,I think I'll miss you most of all.
5708,the wizard of oz,"What a nice little dog. And you, my dear, what an unexpected pleasure. It's so kind of you to want to visit me in my loneliness."
5709,the wizard of oz,"Shucks, folks, I'm speechless. Ha Ha!"
5710,the wizard of oz,"You have no power here! Begone, before somebody drops a house on you, too!"
5711,the wizard of oz,I've got a witch mad at me and you might get into trouble!
5712,the wizard of oz,Only bad witches are ugly.
5713,the woodsman,Uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked.
5714,the world is not enough,James! You can't kill me! Not in cold blood!
5715,the world is not enough,She's waiting for you.
5716,the world is not enough,"There's no point living, if you can't feel alive."
5717,the world is not enough,One tires of being executed.
5718,the x files,"Mulder I can't tell you what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else can, either."
5719,the x files,"Trust no one, Mr. Mulder."
5720,the x files,I need this building evacuated and cleared out in ten minutes. I need you to get on the phone and tell the fire department to block off the city center in a one mile radius around the building. DON'T THINK! JUST PICK UP THE PHONE AND MAKE IT HAPPEN!
5721,the x files,"But you saved me. As difficult and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your God-damned strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times over. You kept me honest. You made me a whole person. I owe you everything, and you owe me nothing. I don't know if I want to do this alone. I don't even know if I can."
5722,the x files,I don't believe the FBI currently has an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.
5723,the x files,Maybe we should call in a bomb threat to Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
5724,the x files,And why do you think you're here talking to me today? These people don't make mistakes!
5725,thelma & louise,"I swear 3 days ago neither one of us would've EVER pulled a stunt like this, but if you'd ever meet my husband you'd understand why."
5726,thelma & louise,"In the future, when a woman is crying like that, she isn't having any fun."
5727,thelma & louise,"Louise, no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you."
5728,thelma & louise,"You let her go, you fuckin' asshole, or I'm gon' splatter your ugly face all over this nice car!"
5729,thelma & louise,"Certain words and phrases just keep drifting through my mind, things like, incarceration, cavity search, death by electrocution, life in prison, shit like that, know what I'm sayin', so do I want to come out alive..."
5730,thelma & louise,"Well, I've always believed that if done properly, armed robbery doesn't have to be an unpleasant experience."
5731,thelma & louise,"Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here."
5732,thelma & louise,"If she calls, just be gentle, you know? Like you're really happy to hear from her. Like you miss her. Women love that shit."
5733,thelma & louise,"You've always been crazy, this is just the first chance you've had to express yourself."
5734,thelma & louise,"Come on, Louise, don't blow it."
5735,there's something about mary,Have you seen my baseball?
5736,there's something about mary,"Your gonna pay, fucker."
5737,there's something about mary,"The last time I had a pap smear, the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker."
5738,there's something about mary,"When I was 16 years old, I fell in love."
5739,there's something about mary,"We agreed I wouldn't fuck you, and you wouldn't fuck me until we got this fuck  outta the fuckin' picture!"
5740,there's something about mary,I couldn't believe that she knew my name. Some of my best friends didn't know my name.
5741,thirteen days,You are in the courtroom of world opinion and you can answer yes or no.
5742,thirteen days,The sun came up. Every day the sun comes up says something about us.
5743,thirteen days,"They're being issued identity cards. When the call comes, the evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather; we meet them there... Of course, that's for morale. Missiles only take five minutes to get here."
5744,thirteen days,"I want to ask you one simple question Mr Ambassador. Do you deny that the Soviet Union has placed and is placing missiles in Cuba? Don't wait for the translation, yes or no?"
5745,thirteen days,We were eyeball to eyeball and I think the other fella just blinked.
5746,thirteen days,We've got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em in a room and kick 'em in the ass until they come up with some solutions... I'll do it.
5747,thirteen days,I'll whistle up some luck for you.
5748,thirteen days,Those goddamn Kennedys are gonna destroy this country if we don't do something about this!
5749,thirteen days,"I'll tell you one thing, Kenny. Those brass hats have one big advantage. That is, if we do what they want us to do, there's none of us gonna be alive to tell them they were wrong."
5750,thirteen days,"We've worked up several military scenarios; before I ask General Taylor to take us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule: If we decide to strike, we must agree now to do it *before* the missiles become operational, because once they are I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least... at least some of them are launched."
5751,thirteen days,"*I* have the authority! I am the commander in chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!"
5752,thirteen days,"If the sun comes up tomorrow, it is only because of men of good will. And that's - that's all there is between us and the devil."
5753,thirteen days,You're a good man; your brother is a good man. I assure you there are other good men. Let us hope the will of good men is enough to counter the terrible strength of this thing that was put in motion.
5754,thirteen days,"Gentlemen, for the last fifteen years, I've fought at this table alongside your predecessors in the struggle against the Soviet. Now I do not wish to seem melodramatic, but I do wish to impress upon you a lesson I learned with bitter tears and great sacrifice. The Soviet understands only one language: action. Respects only one word: force."
5755,thirteen days,"Mr. President, you give me the order right now, my planes will be ready to carry out the air strikes in three days time. All you gotta do is say ""go,"" and my boys will get those Red bastards."
5756,thirteen days,Sleep is for the weak Mr. President.
5757,thirteen days,"Jesus, I... I feel like we caught the Jap carrier steaming for Pearl Harbor."
5758,thirteen days,"Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing."
5759,thirteen days,"Mr. President, the motto I chose for SAC is ""Peace is Our Profession."" Now, God forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear exchange, but, if launched, those missiles from Cuba would kill a lot of Americans. The very presence of those missiles gives the Soviets first-strike capability. Those missiles make a nuclear exchange more likely, and that is why I'm being such a pain in the ass about destroying them, and destroying them immediately."
5760,thirteen days,"This is not a blockade. This is language. A new vocabulary, the likes of which the world has never seen! This is President Kennedy communicating with Secretary Khrushchev!"

5762,thirteen days,"Well, gentlemen, if anybody's got any great ideas, now's the time."

5765,this boy's life,You can get it doggy-style or you can get it laying on your side. Those are your only choices. This is my house and I get to say. Got it?

5769,this boy's life,"Well... You can want in one hand and shit in the other, and see which one fills first."
5770,this boy's life,What about me? What about me? When is it ever Dwight's turn for some consideration? What about me? I'll tell you one thing: You'll remember me!
5771,this boy's life,"I don't believe that crap, you know, I believe there is such a thing as a bad boy, bad clear through. It's gonna be my job to set you straight. That's right, to kill or cure. Kill or cure!"

5776,three kings,"You are all under arrest, you're getting court-martialed and you're gonna show us that bullion."
5777,three kings,"Hey, I don't know if I can do this. I got a family. If I'm gonna shit in a bag for the rest of my life because I got shot after the war was over, that would pretty fucking stupid wouldn't it, Major?"
5778,three kings,Great! A fuckin' tank! That should send us on our way.

5785,ticker,Congratulations. You've just made your first ticker.
5786,timber falls,"We're not violent people, Michael. It pains us to pain you."

5788,tin cup,Greatness courts failure.
5789,tin cup,"Oh, you amuse me, Roy, but I'm the only woman in America born after World War II that thinks astrology's a crock of shit."
5790,tin cup,It's a lock! I hit my 7-iron like John Daly hits the 3.
5791,tin cup,"That's because you think of it as transportation, Boone. Think of it as bragging rights. Think of yourself sitting around the bar, crowing to your cronies about the Cadillac you won from me. They'll forget all about the Winnebago you lost to me."
5792,tin cup,Why do men always insist on measuring their dicks?
5793,tin men,Are you a Lunatic? Are you tellin' me that you didn't see me comin' out of this lot? There's a red light there for cryin' out loud! You're supposed to stop!
5794,titanic,"It's been 84 years, and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in. Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams, and it was. It really was."
5795,titanic,If this is the direction the rats are going that's fine with me!
5796,titanic,"Well, the boy's a hero then! Good for you, son. Well done."
5797,titanic,26 years of experience working against him. He figures anything big enough to sink the ship they're gonna see in time to turn. The ship's too big with too small a rudder. It doesn't corner worth a damn. Everything he knows is wrong.
5798,titanic,"We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world, you know that?"
5799,titanic,"So, you wanna go to a real party?"
5800,titanic,What? Do you think a first class girl can't drink?
5801,titanic,That's one of the good things about Paris: lots of girls willing to take their clothes off.
5802,titanic,"I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose."
5803,titanic,Music to drown by. Now I know I'm in first class.
5804,titanic,"I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it. An endless parade of parties and cotillions, yachts and polo matches. Always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a great precipice, with no one to pull me back, no one who cared... or even noticed."
5805,titanic,"That's John Jacob Astor, the richest man on the ship. His little wifey there, Madeline, is my age and in a delicate condition. See how she's trying to hide it?"
5806,titanic,"I don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter to the White Star Line about all of this."
5807,titanic,God! Look at that thing! You would've gone straight to the bottom.
5808,titanic,Gentlemen. It has been a privilege playing with you tonight.
5809,titanic,You shine up like a new penny.
5810,titanic,Wait a second. You were going to kill youself by jumping off of the Titanic?  All you had to do was wait two days!
5811,titanic,"Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch. Let's stretch her legs."
5812,titanic,"That's the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course. And inherited his millions. But the crash of '29 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistol in his mouth that year. Or so I read."
5813,titanic,"I'll never let go, Jack. I promise."
5814,titanic,"Ah, forget it, boyo. You're as like to have angels fly out your arse as get next to the likes of her."
5815,titanic,"Dive six, here we are again on the deck of Titanic. Two and a half miles down. Three-thousand, eight hundred and twenty-one meters. The pressure outside is three-and-a-half tons per square inch. These windows are nine inches thick, and if they go, it's sayonara in two micro-seconds."
5816,titanic,The last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a porcelain doll.
5817,titanic,Rose is displeased... what to do?
5818,titanic,This was mine. How extraordinary! And it looks the same as it did last time I saw it... The reflection's changed a bit.
5819,titanic,"I can see the Statue of Liberty already!... Very small, of course."
5820,titanic,"Incredible. There's Smith and he's standing there and he's got the iceberg warning in his fucking hand, excuse me, his hand, and he's ordering more speed."
5821,titanic,"I will do this with or without your help, sir, but without, it will take longer."
5822,titanic,"No, thank you. We are dressed in our best and are prepared to go down as gentlemen. But, we would like a brandy."
5823,titanic,"Fifteen-hundred people went into the sea, when Titanic sank from under us. There were twenty boats floating nearby... and only one came back. One. Six were saved from the water, myself included. Six... out of fifteen-hundred. Afterward, the seven-hundred people in the boats had nothing to do but wait... wait to die... wait to live... wait for an absolution... that would never come."
5824,titanic,"Sleep soundly young Rose for I have built you a good ship, strong and true, she's all the lifeboats you need."
5825,titanic,I saw that in a nickelodeon once and I always wanted to do it.
5826,titanic,"You gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal?"
5827,tmnt,Goodnight Dark Prince.
5828,tmnt,There is no place for excuses when you are the LEADER!
5829,tmnt,This night just keeps getting better.
5830,tombstone,I want your blood. And I want your souls. And I want them both right now!
5831,tombstone,It would appear that the strain was more than he could bear.
5832,tombstone,"It's true, you are a good woman. Then again, you may be the antichrist."
5833,tombstone,Fight's commenced! Get to fightin' or get away!
5834,tombstone,"Maybe poker's just not your game, Ike. I know: let's have a spelling contest."
5835,tombstone,And so she walked out of our lives forever.
5836,tombstone,"You die first, get it? Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe, you understand me?"
5837,tombstone,I'm your huckleberry...
5838,tombstone,"Nonsense, I have not yet begun to defile myself."
5839,tombstone,Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
5840,tombstone,"I don't think I'll let you arrest us today, Behan."
5841,tombstone,"Why Johnny Ringo, you look like somebody just walked over your grave."
5842,tombstone,"Sheriff, allow me to present a pair of fellow sophisticates. Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion. Mind your ear, Creek."
5843,tombstone,"Why Ed does this mean we're not friends anymore? You know Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend... I just don't think I could bear it!"
5844,tombstone,"I stand corrected, Wyatt. You're an oak."
5845,tombstone,You gonna do somethin'? Or are you just gonna stand there and bleed?
5846,tomorrow never dies,"Mr Stamper, would you please kill those bastards!"

5873,traffic,I have a job for you but I don't have much time.
5874,traffic,Now get out of the car and shoot him in the head!
5875,traffic,"On the good days, I feel like I get it, like it all makes sense. I can stay in the moment, I don't have to control everything in the future, and I believe everything is gonna work out fine. On the bad days I just want to grab the phone and start dialing numbers. I want to pull my hair and run through the streets screaming. But thanks to the people I've met in these rooms, like Margaret and Jim and Sarah, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna make it through today."
5876,traffic,"If there is a war on drugs, then many of our family members are the enemy. And I don't know how you wage war on your own family."
5877,trainspotting,"It seems, however, I really am the luckiest guy in the world. Several years of addiction right in the middle of an epidemic, surrounded by the living dead. But not me. I'm negative. It's official. And once the pain goes away, that's when the real battle starts. Depression, boredom... You feel so fucking low, you want to fucking top yourself."
5878,trainspotting,It was fuckin' obvious that that cunt was gonnae fuck some cunt.
5879,trainspotting,"Ursula Andress, the quintessential Bond girl. That's what everyone says. The embodiment of his superiority over us. Beautiful, exotic, highly sexual and totally unavaiable to anyone apart from him. Shite. Let's face it. She can shag one punter from Edinburgh, she'd shag the whole lot of us."
5880,trainspotting,"I don't feel the sickness yet, but it's in the post. That's for sure. I'm in the junkie limbo at the moment. Too ill to sleep. Too tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way. Sweat, chills, nausea. Pain and craving. A need like nothing else I've ever known will soon take hold of me. It's on its way."
5881,trainspotting,"Thank you, your honor. With God's help I'll conquer this terrible affliction."
5882,trainspotting,We called him Mother Superior on account of the length of his habit.
5883,trainspotting,Phew! I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978!
5884,trainspotting,"Now I've justified this to myself in all sorts of ways. It wasn't a big deal, just a minor betrayal. Or we'd outgrown each other, you know, that sort of thing. But let's face it, I ripped them off - my so called mates. But Begbie, I couldn't give a shit about him. And Sick Boy, well he'd done the same to me, if he'd only thought of it first. And Spud, well okay, I felt sorry for Spud - he never hurt anybody. So why did I do it? I could offer a million answers - all false. The truth is that I'm a bad person. But, that's gonna change - I'm going to change. This is the last of that sort of thing. Now I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on, going straight and choosing life. I'm looking forward to it already. I'm gonna be just like you. The job, the family, the fucking big television. The washing machine, the car, the compact disc and electric tin opener, good health, low cholesterol, dental insurance, mortgage, starter home, leisure wear, luggage, three piece suite, DIY, game shows, junk food, children, walks in the park, nine to five, good at golf, washing the car, choice of sweaters, family Christmas, indexed pension, tax exemption, clearing gutters, getting by, looking ahead, the day you die."
5885,trainspotting,"This was to be my final hit, but let's be clear about this. There's final hits and final hits. What kind was this to be?"
5886,trainspotting,"Heroin had robbed Renton of his sex drive, but now it returned with a vengeance. And as the impotence of those days faded into memory, grim desperation took hold of his sex-crazed mind. His post-junk libido, fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine, taunted him remorselessly with his own unsatisfied desire."
5887,trainspotting,"Armed robbery. With a replica. I mean, how the fuck can it be armed robbery with a fucking replica?"
5888,trainspotting,"Heroin makes you constipated. The heroin from my last hit was fading, and the suppositories had yet to melt.  I'm no longer constipated."
5889,trainspotting,"Two kilos. What's that, about ten years? Mikey Forrester, Russian sailors, what the fuck are you boys on, eh?"
5890,trainspotting,"Relinquishing junk. Stage one, preparation. For this you will need one room which you will not leave. Soothing music. Tomato soup, ten tins of. Mushroom soup, eight tins of, for consumption cold. Ice cream, vanilla, one large tub of. Magnesia, milk of, one bottle. Paracetamol, mouthwash, vitamins. Mineral water, Lucozade, pornography. One mattress. One bucket for urine, one for feces and one for vomitus. One television and one bottle of Valium, which I've already procured from my mother, who is, in her own domestic and socially acceptable way also a drug addict. And now I'm ready. All I need is one final hit to soothe the pain while the Valium takes effect."
5891,trainspotting,"Well, this is a good fucking laugh, ain't it? You sweat that shite out of your system. 'Cause if I come back and it's still here... I'll fucking kick it out. Okay?"
5892,trainspotting,"Better than sex, Rents. Better than sex. The ultimate hit. I'm a fucking adult, I can find out for meself. Well I'm finding out all right."
5893,trainspotting,"Picture the scene: The other fuckin' week there, doin' the fuckin' Volley with Tommy, playing pool. I'm playing like Paul-Fuckin'-Newman by the way. Givin' the boy here the tannin' of a lifetime. So it comes to there, during the last shot, the deciding ball of the whole tournament. I'm on the black and he's sittin' in the corner looking all fuckin' biscuit-arsed. When this hard cunt comes in. Obviously fuckin' fancied himself, like. Starts staring at me. Lookin' at me, right fuckin' at me, as if to say, ""Come ahead, square go."" You ken me, I'm not the type of cunt that goes looking for fuckin' bother, like, but at the end of the day I'm the cunt with a pool cue and he can get the fat end in his puss any time he fucking wanted like. So I squares up, casual like. What does the hard cunt do? Or the so-called hard cunt? Shites it. Puts down his drink, turns, and gets the fuck out of there. And after that, well, the game was mine."
5894,trainspotting,And with that Mark Renton had fallen in love.

6010,twin peaks: fire walk with me,"Diane, it is 4:20 PM. I'm standing on the bank of Wind River near the location of where the body of Teresa Banks was found. Diane, this case gives me a strange feeling. Not only has Special Agent Chester Desmond dissappeared without a trace, but this is one of Cole's blue rose cases. The clues that were found by Special Agent Desmond and Agent Stanley have led to dead ends. The letter that was extracted from beneath the fingernail of Teresa Banks gives me the feeling that the killer will strike again. But like the song goes, ""who knows where, or when?"""

6046,unbreakable,"And, to answer your question, there are two reasons why I'm looking at you like this. One because it seems in a few minutes you will officially be the only survivor of this train wreck, and two, because you didn't break one bone, you don't have a scratch on you."
6047,under fire,"I like you people, but you are sentimental shits! You fall in love with the poets; the poets fall in love with the Marxists; the Marxists fall in love with themselves. The country falls in love with the rhetoric, and in the end we are stuck with tyrants."

6093,vanilla sky,My dreams are a cruel joke. They taunt me. Even in my dreams I'm an idiot... who knows he's about to wake up to reality. If I could only avoid sleep. But I can't. I try to tell myself what to dream. I try to dream that I am flying. Something free. It never works...

And if you feel the same way, then we should not hide it any longer.  It's a gift, love is! We should be thankful! We should bellow it out with all the breath in our lungs! Thank you! Thank you!  THANK YOU!"
6139,village,"I know why you denied my sister. When I was younger, you used to hold my arm when I walked. Then suddenly you stopped. One day, I even tripped in your presence and nearly fell.

One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulating to widows and idiot sons and what I do, stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. You got ninety percent of the American public out there with little or no net worth. I create nothing. I own. We make the rules, pal. The news, war, peace, famine, upheaval, the price per paper clip. We pick that rabbit out of the hat while everybody sits out there wondering how the hell we did it. Now you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy, are you buddy?

They were undone, destroyed, after all of man's weapons and devices had failed, by the tiniest creatures that God in his wisdom put upon this earth. By the toll of a billion deaths, man had earned his immunity, his right to survive among this planet's infinite organisms. And that right is ours against all challenges. For neither do men live nor die in vain."
6175,war of the worlds,"No one would have believed in the early years of the 21st century that our world was being watched by intelligences greater than our own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns, *they* observed and studied, the way a man with a microscope might scrutinize the creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency, men went to and fro about the globe, confident of our empire over this world. Yet across the gulf of space, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our planet with envious eyes and slowly, and surely, drew their plans against us."

He's gonna find out that the world is a horrible place and that people suck soon enough and without any help from you!"
